<h2 class="vspace">Hearings Before the President's Commission<br />

on the<br />

Assassination of President Kennedy</h2>

<h2 id="jhm"><span class="smaller"><a name="Thursday_February_27_1964_Afternoon_Session" id="Thursday_February_27_1964_Afternoon_Session"><i>Thursday, February 27, 1964</i>&mdash;<i>Afternoon Session</i></a></span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF JAMES HERBERT MARTIN RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Gentlemen, the Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>Are you ready to continue the testimony, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Will you carry forward, Mr. Redlich?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I would like to hand you a group of newspaper
clippings which have not as yet been introduced in evidence and I would ask
you to look through them and to pick out any which you feel create an image
of Mrs. Marina Oswald which you feel does not conform to the reality of her
personality, as you know it, and ask you in regard to each one to tell us in
what respect the facts as reported in each of these clippings do not conform
to the real person as you know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I assume we can avoid repetition, can't we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Incidents here have been touched on in other papers and we
don't need to touch them again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>During the intermission we have gone through all of the newspaper clippings
and eliminated the duplicate stories and hope to eliminate duplicate facts as we
go along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, this one is inaccurate that it doesn't have anything to
do with her image, so to speak. It says she spent <span class="locked">Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. For the sake of the record if we are going to have comment
on them I would like to have them introduced as evidence because the record
wouldn't state what they are about.</p>

<p>Are you going to make comment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Do you want me to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. If you are going to make comment about it, if you feel there
is some inaccuracy here then I would like to introduce that in evidence, since
apparently you are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It is inaccurate as far as the date in the article is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The witness has handed to us a newspaper story which we
have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 328.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we have the inaccuracy mentioned here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes, the headline of which is "Mrs. Oswald Will Bare Life of
Mate" and I request it be admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any objection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 328 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit No. 328 and ask you if there
are any inaccuracies in that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. "Mrs. Oswald and Her Children Now Make Their Home at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Undisclosed Hotel" which is inaccurate&mdash;"and it was in that motel room,
somewhere in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that the youngest Oswald child spent
her first Christmas. There was a tree, toys and even a visit from Mrs. Oswald's
brother who lives 30 miles to the north in Denton, Tex."</p>

<p>That was the inaccuracy that she spent Christmas not in a motel but in our
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is about from 3 o'clock in the afternoon as I recall until
7:30 in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; that was Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was Thanksgiving. Spent the whole day of Christmas in
your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she lived there. She was at our home 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>This one&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The witness has produced before the Commission a newspaper
story which we have labeled as Commission Exhibit No. 329, the headline of
which reads, "Money Gifts to Tippit's Near $200,000 Mark."</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I request that Commission Exhibit No. 329 be admitted in
evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any objection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It shall be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 329 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I hand you Exhibit No. 329 and ask you if it is
inaccurate in any respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The article states that Mrs. Shirley Williamson, a Fort Worth
housewife, who felt compassion for the widow, Mrs. Oswald, and the two babies
said the fund for the Russian-born widow had reached $76,000."</p>

<p>The fund that Mrs. Williamson collected amounted to some $2,600. That was
her total. That is the inaccuracy there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is she referring to the funds she collected or the whole collections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Her funds. This has come up numerous times. We even called
her about it one time. She had given out press releases that she had collected
personally, I think, in excess of $8,000, whereas what she was doing was
adding what she had collected to what had already been sent to Marina, and saying
that she was holding that money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But even that total is exaggerated, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At that time, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The total collections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At that time, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, this article also makes reference to the fund on
behalf of the wife of Officer Tippit with which, of course, you have no connection.</p>

<p>I would like to ask you, however, whether at the time you extended the
offer to Marina Oswald to live in your home you were aware of the fact that
there were funds being raised for Officer Tippit's wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I was undoubtedly aware of it but I don't recall any conscious
knowledge of it or thinking of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall whether you were aware at the time that there
were any funds coming in on behalf of Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You were not aware?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not aware, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The witness has offered to, has presented to, the Commission
a newspaper story appearing in the Buffalo Evening News, December 7, 1963,
headline of which reads, "Oswald's Widow Reported Hoping to be U.S. Citizen."</p>

<p>This story has been identified as Commission Exhibit No. 330 and I ask that
it be introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any objection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Accepted.</p>

<p>(The newspaper article referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 330
for identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I show you Commission's Exhibit No. 330 and
ask you if it is inaccurate in any respect to the best of your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. In the second paragraph it says, "Mrs. Oswald, 23," which is
inaccurate&mdash;"Russian-born Mother of Three&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Will you state the inaccuracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The age is inaccurate. She is 22, "Russian-born Mother of
Three" that is inaccurate. She is the mother of two, "burst into tears when
she learned at least $7,700 had been sent to her by sympathetic Americans."</p>

<p>There was no burst of tears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Will you tell the Commission what the reaction was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I would say of happiness rather than&mdash;she was glad that that
was there, which is normal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall anything she told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. This was December 7. No, I have no recollection of anything
that she said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Didn't you testify before, maybe it is with regard to another
or similar clipping, that she had some reference to the silly Americans who
were giving this money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it was a comment she had made at sometime or another.
I don't know whether it was during this particular thing or not. I think it
was further on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. On a similar occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. A little later date, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, you have commented on the respects in which the
newspaper clippings were at variance with the facts about Marina Oswald as
you knew them.</p>

<p>Are there any other facts which perhaps were not reflected in these clippings
but which you might be aware of in respect to which the public image of Marina
Oswald differed from the true person that you knew on the basis of your contact
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. Of course, she is not the least bit frugal. She spends
money quite freely, which it is her money to spend, but it won't last very long
at the rate it is going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. In connection with that did Marina Oswald ever discuss with
you the financial difficulties she may have encountered while she was married
to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. She remarked one time that she had always wished for
$500 just to do with as she wanted. She also mentioned that the small amount
of money that it took them to live upon. She said it ran between $130 and
$135 a month.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she complain about this limited amount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I asked her how she could live on that little and she said
well, all they had was rent and food, and occasionally she would get a dress
or get a pair of shoes. She said that she didn't object to it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But when more money became available she found
ways and means of spending it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Well, she mentioned one time to me that&mdash;I told her
she was spending too much money, and she said, "Well, when it is all gone I
will go to work." That <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is a little Russian, may I say for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, this Commission has recovered information to the
effect that the public announcements which you made concerning the amount
of funds which had been collected on Marina Oswald's behalf actually reflected
figures that were less than the amount which had actually been collected on
her behalf.</p>

<p>Without getting into specific figures at this time, are these reports correct
in your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Which report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The <span class="locked">report&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, yes, we were obtaining a smaller figure, that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That is true. Did you consult with Marina Oswald on this
policy on reporting to the press a lesser figure than had actually been collected?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What was your reason for doing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. To&mdash;well, the money she had collected was considerable, and
most people in their life don't accumulate that much money in their entire
lifetime.</p>

<p>What we were trying to do for her was to build enough of a&mdash;enough capital
to furnish her from the interest a steady income. And by keeping the figure
down figured it would increase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I don't want to put words in your mouth. Could you be a
little more specific about your reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, so people would keep contributing to her cause.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And she was in accord with this policy of keeping the public
amount at a low figure so that people would contribute to her cause?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I would like to revert to a point that you made this morning
to clear up the record. You said that you left your job at the Six Flags Inn
Motel because of your obligations to Marina Oswald. Did you leave the job
voluntarily or were you fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I left voluntarily. I actually left on the 15th of December, and
I had a week's vacation coming, they gave me that which paid me to the 1st
of January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you met Mrs. Oswald in late November and in your
conversations with her at that time, did she discuss with you the fact of her
husband's trip to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you n<span class="locked">ow&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She did at a later date, sometime in January before she went
to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When did you first learn of Lee Oswald's trip to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I guess it was from newspaper accounts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you read it in the newspapers did you ask Marina
about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What prompted you to discuss with Marina in January the
question of her knowledge about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see&mdash;she told me when the FBI was questioning her one
day, she told me that they had information that he had attempted suicide, and
that particular day she didn't want to see the FBI at all, and she was a little bit
unhappy with them and I just asked her what else did she learn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who else was present at this conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't think anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Just you and Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who was this who had attempted suicide, I didn't catch that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That was in Russia sometime before, I think before he met
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And she said she had heard this from the FBI or the FBI had
asked her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The FBI had read, I think, in his manuscript that he had
attempted suicide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And they asked her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She didn't know that. Yes. And at that time I asked her if
she learned anything else, and she said no, but that they still didn't know that
she knew that he had gone to Mexico, and at that time we were talking about
the Commission, that general area of time, and I mentioned to be sure to tell
the truth to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ask her why she had not revealed knowledge of her
trip&mdash;of her knowledge of Lee Oswald's trip to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I can't recall exactly whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ask her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have a recollection but I have no idea what was said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you and she discuss the purpose of Lee Oswald's trip to
Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you say you advised her to tell this Commission about that
trip to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you were here and she testified did you inquire of her
as to whether in fact she did tell this Commission about the trip to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I inquired of John Thorne and he said that she had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. But in connection with the Nixon incident, you indicated earlier
in your testimony that you had not inquired of her as to whether she had told
this Commission about the Nixon incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you think that the Nixon incident was of less importance
than the Mexican trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I didn't quite believe the Nixon incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you believe it now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know. I don't know if there is any corroboration other
than her say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. It was because you had doubts about the actual existence of the
incident that you didn't pursue with her the question as to whether she should
tell this Commission about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I didn't tell her not to say anything about it. I didn't
mention it specifically at all. The only thing I told her to do was to tell the
Commission the truth in all cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At the conclusion of each day's testimony while she was here
before this Commission did you discuss the nature of her testimony with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I asked her how the day went. And she would tell me,
"fine," and that was the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. But you did inquire specifically about the Mexico trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Because I knew she lied about that to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are there any other incidents you knew she had lied about to
the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That is the only one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you and Marina Oswald ever discuss the question of her
husband's rifle practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. The only time I recall that ever being asked of her was
at the press conference here in Washington, and I never specifically asked her
at all, whether he practiced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ever discuss with her the question of Lee Oswald's
ownership of a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you discussed the General Walker incident with her, did
you discuss his ownership of a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. The only thing, I think about the only thing I asked her
about that was how he got there and how he got back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said he walked and took the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And you didn't ask her what weapon he had shot at General
Walker with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. That was in the newspaper, it was a rifle. And there were
many things I didn't ask about because I was previously informed through
the news or I thought I was anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You specifically, with regard to the rifle, you are telling this
Commission that you had no conversations with Marina Oswald concerning her
husband's practice with the rifle either in Dallas or in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see&mdash;I think I did discuss with her one time at the rifle
range out in Grand Prairie was it, wherever it was, that the owner had seen
Lee Harvey Oswald out there with a rifle, and he drove up in a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who is "they"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The owner of the rifle range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You say they drove up in a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He drove up in a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The owner of the rifle range?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Drove to the rifle range in a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he drive himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, this is a report from the rifle range owner who said he
had seen Lee Harvey Oswald there on numerous occasions practicing, and that
he drove up in a car by himself. He always came by himself, and I did ask
her if he could drive and she said no, definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Where did you read this report or where did you hear about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was right after the start there, in the Dallas papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. This was something you read. This was not a personal conversation
you had with the owner of the rifle range?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, it was a newspaper account.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were there any other conversations you had with Mrs. Oswald
concerning rifle practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you have any conversations with her concerning Lee Oswald's
ability as a rifleman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald ever discuss with you the fears that she
claims to have had that Lee Oswald would attempt to kill a public figure as
a result specifically of the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, other than when she told me that she told him that if he
tried anything similar to the Walker incident she would have him arrested.
And she never mentioned to me a particular figure that he would do anything
like that. She evidently had it though or she wouldn't have made the threat
to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Other than the Nixon incident, and the Walker incident, Mrs.
Oswald never related to you any other specific incident with regard to the
attempt to take the life of anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald, Marina, ever indicate to you her
feeling toward guns; did she ever indicate any apprehension about having
one in the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Related to rifles, pistols?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have a 22 rifle in the house, for instance. Of course, she may
never have seen it. But I don't believe the question ever came up at all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She never indicated to you that she had told Lee Harvey
Oswald that she was apprehensive about his use of a gun or his having a
gun in the household?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I would like to ask you whether Mrs. Oswald ever
discussed with you any aspects of the life of Marina Oswald and Lee Harvey
Oswald while they were in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see now&mdash;she mentioned one time to both my wife and I
that Lee had gone to Moscow, I believe, and an old boy friend called her up
and she went out with him while Lee was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she indicate to you at that time the purpose of Lee's trip
to Moscow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she indicate to you whether she had told Lee about her going
out with this old boy friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said she did tell him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By the way, would you recall when Lee made this trip to
Moscow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I don't think she mentioned the date at all. She may have
but I don't recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she indicate in connection with this trip of Lee Oswald
to Moscow that she herself subsequently went to Moscow while he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I think she said he was gone one day or one night and
came back the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. So that on the basis of your recollection, if there was a trip
in which Lee Oswald went to Moscow and she joined him there this was a
different trip from the one you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Just to make sure of this you say to the best of your recollection
she said he went there for one day and returned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Can you think of any other aspects of their life in the Soviet
Union that Marina discussed with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He used to like her aunt. Now, which aunt I don't know. Yes,
I do. It is the aunt that is working as a secretary and her husband is on a
pension. She has an aunt and an uncle by blood.</p>

<p>Now, the aunt's husband is on a pension, and the uncle's&mdash;The uncle is a lieutenant
colonel in the Soviet Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Now, the aunt and uncle that you say she liked very much,
is this the aunt and uncle with whom she was living at the time she met Lee
Oswald or is this a different aunt and uncle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That was all very&mdash;always confusing to me because she wouldn't
call the spouse of the aunt, for instance, her uncle, and I couldn't tell all the time
which party she was talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These were both relatives to Marina, therefore, they were not
married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, no; they were not married to each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is what I mean, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There were two couples, and the aunt in one couple and the uncle
in the other couple. But she didn't refer to the opposite spouse as an aunt and
uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Does the name Berlov refresh your recollection any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Berlov?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina ever indicate to you anything about her education,
what school she attended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, just the school of pharmacy, and she compared her grade
school or our grade school, which is, I guess similar to our grade school in high
school or junior high, anyway.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She only referred to the pharmacy training?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As any special training she received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But she did discuss that with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not at length. Just stated the fact that she had finished pharmacy
school.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But she didn't discuss any other training or schooling of
a special nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she ever discuss any special training that Lee might
have had while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she ever discuss Lee's employment while he was
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Only that he was unhappy where he was working.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she tell you where he worked, the kind of work he
was doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know, I have an idea it was in a factory of some kind,
whether she told me that or whether it was an assumption, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she ever discuss their apartment, their living quarters in
Minsk?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, she said she had a one-room apartment, and had a balcony
on it, and that as soon as the baby was born they were going to move to a larger
one. I questioned her about that because I understand it is quite difficult to
get more than a one-room apartment in Russia and she said, well, Lee was an
American and he could get things the Russians couldn't get.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald give you the impression that in general she
and Lee Oswald had better treatment than other Russians?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, and actually her past life even before she met Lee seemed
a little bit strange to me, going to the opera, taking vacations and holidays
as she says. I understand it is quite expensive to go to the opera, and she was
making, what did she say, 45 rubles a month, and she would take a girl friend
with her when she went to the opera.</p>

<p>Now, how much that cost, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ever question her about her financial situation in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I asked her how she could afford it and she said she got by.
She was living at home or with her aunt and uncle. So I imagine their expenses
there weren't high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she mention any extra income which Lee Harvey Oswald
may have had apart from his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; I asked her about that specifically because I had heard an
account that he was supposed to be getting Western Union money orders, and
asked her about that. She didn't know what a Western Union money order was,
for one thing, so I reworded the question and asked if he was getting money from
anyone else other than where he was working, and she said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. This was true of this life in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, apparently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina ever discuss with you the uncle with whom she
lived who was apparently a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; except she didn't like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she say why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. She preferred her aunt, who has the husband on the pension.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Can you search your memory at this point and tell this Commission
anything that you have not yet told us about Marina's conversations
with you concerning her life in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Her aunt used to bring food and liquor home after parties had
at the government building where she was working. Other than talking about&mdash;she
pulled one tooth out before she came to the United States. A tooth was
either crooked or broken and she pulled the tooth out. That caused the other
one to twist. I don't know what that was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina ever indicate to you while she was in the
Soviet Union that she drank beer, wine, liquor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Vodka.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When she came to the United States, you could observe
it, did she drink beer, wine, liquor of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She drank, I guess she drank a bottle of beer every day, and
occasionally she would drink some vodka.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But not a heavy drinker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, have you ever been curious about how Mrs. Oswald
was ever able to leave the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I wasn't, until Don Levine brought up the subject. Of
course, I have no idea what it entails to get into Russia or out of it as far as
that is concerned.</p>

<p>But according to Mr. Levine, it is extremely difficult for people to get out of
Russia, especially when they have had the training that Marina has had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By training you mean what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Pharmacy. He said they spent quite a bit of money on her
training, and he doesn't understand how she got out of Russia on such short
notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ever ask this question of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said that Lee arranged it, and that is all she would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. She never discussed any other aspect of her departure from
the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. Let's see, they were in Moscow, she waited a couple of days
while he was, how did she put it, collecting money or getting money together
to come over to the States. I have forgotten the name of the hotel they stayed in.
She even remarked they had pancakes every morning and she didn't like
pancakes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. In terms of her official negotiations to leave the Soviet Union,
you asked her nothing other than the question that I have already discussed
with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, she said that Lee arranged everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I would like to ask you a few questions now about some of the
individuals that Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald knew in Fort Worth and
Dallas, and ask you in each case whether Marina Oswald discussed any of
these individuals with you.</p>

<p>The first is George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I know the name but I don't think Marina has ever mentioned
him; Katya Ford has though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you personally acquainted with George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us what Katya Ford has told you about Mr.
Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was relating to Marina&mdash;I think Katya Ford and Bouhe are
friends, and they had been discussing Marina all the time she was in seclusion,
and wondering what had happened to her, where she was. Now this was after
the news was out where she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you acquainted <span class="locked">with&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Excuse me, by "in seclusion", you mean at the time she was
with you in your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, and the press didn't know where she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you acquainted with George De Mohrenschildt or his wife
Jean De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you ever discussed either George or Jean De Mohrenschildt
with Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you ever discussed George and Jean De Mohrenschildt
with anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you ever hear the name mentioned before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I think I would remember that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you personally acquainted with Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I met him once, maybe twice, at the Inn. He was interpreting
for Marina, for the Secret Service, I believe, before Lee Gopadze got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you know who he is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I understand he is a geologist, and he also teaches Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina ever discuss either Peter Gregory or Paul Gregory
with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She mentioned&mdash;I don't know which one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. One is the father and one is a son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think it is the older gentleman that I met. She mentioned that
she liked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The older gentleman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. And I think she corresponded with him. I know she corresponded
with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have any knowledge of Mr. Gregory's son?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you ever met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You have had no conversations with anyone else about him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. We were&mdash;I think John Thorne and I were talking about at
sometime we may need an interpreter, and I mentioned his name in that instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That would be the elder Mr. Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. But nothing on Paul Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Nothing on Paul Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you aware of the fact that Paul Gregory is a student at the
University of Oklahoma?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina ever discuss with you the fact that she had helped
tutor the son of Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you familiar with&mdash;strike that.
Do you have any personal acquaintanceship with Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you ever heard the name of Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Marina Oswald has never discussed that name with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you know Mrs. Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Elena Hall? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Has Marina ever discussed her with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The name John R. Hall, who is the husband of Mrs. Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, it sounded a little familiar but I can't place anything on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you know Mrs. Katherine Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us how you came to know her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, she had contacted Marina a couple of times by letter,
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. While she was staying at your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes&mdash;well, she sent the letter to Grand Prairie, the letters,
Christmas cards, and I think two letters after that. So I called her and Marina
wanted to, expressed a desire to, talk to her. So I called her and Marina talked
to her on the phone. I think every time she talked to her she talked nearly an
hour.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In Russian or in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. In Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was it on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina ever tell you the gist of these conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina ever relate to you whether she had ever lived in
Mrs. Ford's home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe she had for a very short time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You mean Marina related this to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think Mrs. Ford told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. How did you get this knowledge, from Marina or from Mrs.
Ford? Did you ever discuss this with Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I know Marina likes her home, I mean likes the house that
they live in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ever ask Marina how it came about that she was
separated from her husband and living at the home of Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did any of Marina's other Russian-speaking friends in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area write letters to her while she was at your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Mrs. Paine wrote at least once a week <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Once a week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Marina did not answer, didn't answer any of the letters
and didn't call her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Mrs. Paine attempt to reach Marina by phone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, until I had my telephone number changed and then she
couldn't find the phone number so she came over to the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What happened when she came to the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Nothing, I let her in the house and Marina and the children were
back in the den and the Secret Service men went back into the den, and I don't
believe she knew that she was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was the change in number, did it have anything to do with
Marina as objecting to receiving the calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. That was strictly because the press pressure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The presence of the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I would like to go back to this incident when Mrs. Paine came
to see Marina. You say Marina did not know that Mrs. Paine was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, she knew it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. She knew that Mrs. Paine was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Mrs. Paine didn't know that Marina was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. But Marina knew that Mrs. Paine was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina see Mrs. Paine at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you talk to Marina at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, before and after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At the time Mrs. Paine was there did you personally tell
Marina that Mrs. Paine wanted to see her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I told her before Mrs. Paine came in the door that Mrs. Paine
was here, and she said she didn't want to see her. She stayed in the den, and
Mrs. Paine was in the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Then did you convey this message to Mrs. Paine yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she came with the intention or for the purpose of bringing
a package to Marina that she had received in the mail, and I don't believe
she knew that Marina was living there. I told her at that time that because
of security that Marina wasn't seeing anyone but I don't believe she knew
that Marina was at that address until later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When Mrs. Paine called your home prior to the change of
phone, did you speak to Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, my wife did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall the nature of the conversations between your
wife and Mrs. Paine as reported to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, let's see, she called and asked for Marina or asked to
get in touch with Marina. My wife gave me the number and I guess I called
her back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You called Mrs. Paine back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. A day or two later, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did you say to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I told her that under the present circumstances she just didn't
want to see anybody, and also the security on her didn't permit her to go out
too far. That we could possibly arrange a meeting at some middle point
later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Was Marina free to see anyone she wanted to see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And the reason she didn't see Mrs. Paine was because she
didn't want to see Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I asked her several times to call her, at least call Mrs.
Paine and tell her she didn't want to see her, and she just shrugged her shoulders
and said she didn't want to talk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina ever tell you why she didn't want to talk to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said something about Mrs. Paine talking too much, and she
didn't like Mrs. Paine's children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you aware at the time that Marina had lived with Mrs.
Paine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you aware at the time that Mrs. Paine had taken the
Oswald family to New Orleans and <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Gone to New Orleans and brought them back to Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, that is why I felt she owed Mrs. Paine something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What was Marina's attitude toward your comments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She just didn't want to talk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you yourself ever meet Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you describe that meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, the first time I met her was we went over to the Paine's
house to pick up some of Marina's belongings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who is "we"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. John Thorne and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall about when this was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I guess it was about a week after she had moved in, maybe
shorter, maybe sooner than that. There was not much said at all at that
meeting. Then when she came out to the house she talked at length, but it
<span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. There is another occasion when you say she came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. When she came to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That was the same occasion that you referred to earlier when
she came to pick up a package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. To deliver a package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. To deliver a package, I am sorry. Could you relate what
happened at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I was quite distracted by the children. It was rather a stiff
meeting or conversation.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was the meeting at Mrs. Paine's house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, my house.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Mrs. Paine brought, I think, a package and some food, cookies,
things like that, for Marina, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Those are from Mrs. Paine to Marina, but the package was a
<span class="locked">third&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The package came through the mail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That you understand, but the cookies came from Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>I believe she brought some toys for the children. What the toys were, I
don't recall. Her children were running back and forth through the living
room making quite a bit of noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mrs. Paine's children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. And I wasn't really paying too much attention to what
she was saying. I was wanting her to leave. I didn't ask her to leave but I
wasn't saying much to foster the conversation. Then she left in, I guess, 15
minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did Mrs. Paine say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, <span class="locked">boy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was she disturbed, I mean was she annoyed, visibly annoyed,
that Marina wouldn't see her. She didn't know Marina was in the house, I
realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She didn't know Marina was in the house. I am certain she
didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You mean her children were running around the house though,
weren't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Her children were running in the living room and dining room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But not into the den?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. But not into the den and kitchen.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you have a door on the den so you can close the den
off?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. She talked mostly about generalities and she would like
to see Marina to make sure she is well taken care of, and so on. She was concerned
about her. And she came back after that time, she came back once more.
I wasn't there. My wife answered the door and didn't invite her in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How long a trip is it from your house to Mrs. Paine's, roughly,
a few miles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, a good 20 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A good 20 miles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Because it is 30 miles out to the Inn, and she lives about 8 or
10 miles toward me from the Inn, so it is about 20 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Your wife did not invite Mrs. Paine into the house at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Was this at Marina's urging?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Mrs. Paine was quite upset at that&mdash;that is what Wanda
said, she looked upset at that time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On this occasion, did Mrs. Paine know Marina was in
the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she ask where she was, specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She didn't ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What was the purpose of her visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't believe&mdash;let's see, she may have brought something that
day, too. I don't recall whether she did or not. I know right after that, the
Civil Liberties Union got into it. Well, Mark Lane, was first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You say right after that Mark Lane got into it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you elaborate on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Mark Lane came to Dallas, and contacted John Thorne and I.
We met him at the Statler and talked to him at lunch, and he expressed a
desire to talk to Marina Oswald so that he could represent her husband, defend
her husband in a hearing, and we told him that we would relay that information
to her.</p>

<p>So we did, and she said that she didn't want to have any representation. She
didn't want any <span class="locked">more&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You mean she didn't want any representation for Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, she didn't want any more to do about it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you recall the date of this visit by Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it in December or January?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was in January, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And you transmitted Mr. Lane's message to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, and she said that she didn't want any representation for
Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you tell her this in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, and explained it to her, and at that time she could understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. To your knowledge, did Marina ever meet Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to my knowledge, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And you also related the Ruth Paine, second Ruth Paine, visit
to your home to something which you referred to as the American Civil Liberties
Union business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was right after&mdash;these incidents happened rather closely.
The letter from the Civil Liberties Union&mdash;well, first we received a telephone
call from the Civil Liberties Union wanting to see Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Telephone call from Dallas or New York, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. From Richardson, the same person who wrote the letter which
you have there. Do you have that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We do have. We are inventorying many of these documents
of which the American Civil Liberties letter is one and we will introduce it
at an appropriate time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Richardson is a suburb of Dallas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
This gentleman called, what was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. I can't remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if I mentioned the name
Olds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, Greg Olds. He called on the phone and wanted to see
Marina Oswald, wanted to make sure she was being properly represented,
that she knew her rights, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>John Thorne talked to him, and told him that he represented Marina
Oswald, and that he was definitely sure that all her rights were being
observed.</p>

<p>Then I think there was another phone call from them still wanting to see
Marina Oswald, and I talked to Marina and she said well, she would talk
to him. So they arranged a meeting with a third party, I can't remember his
name, who was a minister of some kind, and then Marina changed her mind
and said no, she didn't want to go at all, she didn't want to talk to any of
them. So then they wrote the letter. They wrote a letter to her in Russian
and sent one to me in English, one to John Thorne in English, and I
believe one to the Secret Service and one to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Do you want to mention about their press releases at this
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There were a number of press releases at that time also that
she was being held incognito and not able <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You mean incognito or incommunicado?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Incommunicado.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Press releases by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The Civil Liberties Union, and so they sent this letter to her
and she answered it with a two-page letter in Russian.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have a copy of that two-page letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. She wrote it, put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it
and I mailed it. I didn't open it or look in it in any way. And that
seemed to be the end of it, but they still persisted they wanted to see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And the reason Marina did not see them was entirely her
own volition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Her own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She never talked to you about what was in the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, she said she just told them she didn't want to see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In two pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; This was quoted, a portion of the letter was quoted,
in the Worker.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I suggest, Mr. Chairman, that we get, if possible, a
copy of the original of that letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. You probably can get it from Greg Olds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you make a note of that. I think we should do that.</p>

<p>That was dated sometime in the middle of January?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe so. The letter you have&mdash;she wadded the letter up
that was written to her in Russian and threw it away, and I got it back
out, and asked her to go ahead and write them a letter so it would quiet
them. So she said she would and she wrote a letter, I think, that night, so
it would be within a couple of days of the date of that letter, the English
copy of which you have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Chairman, if you would like, we could take a 3- or 4-minute
recess and I could get the American Civil Liberties Union letter to
Marina Oswald and introduce it at this time for the sake of clarity in the
record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Good. It is a good time for a breather.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right, gentlemen, the Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>You are familiar with, Mr. Dulles, you are familiar with, the hearing
up to date. You go right ahead and preside, if you will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Redlich will you go right ahead with your questions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I believe Congressman Ford, you said you wanted to ask
your questions prior to your leaving.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you wish to have that letter entered as an exhibit
at this point before I ask several questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The witness has produced before this Commission a letter
which I now mark Commission Exhibit No. 331 on the Dallas Civil Liberties
Union stationery, addressed to Mr. John Thorne, James Martin, Mr.
Sorrels, Secret Service, Mrs. Lee H. Oswald, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>I ask that it be introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any objection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It will be introduced.</p>

<p>(The letter referred to was marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 331 and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Have you seen it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, we have introduced that because just
prior to the recess we were discussing it and Congressman Ford indicated
he had to leave I believe and I wanted to ask some questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question on this letter for clarification? It is
my understanding it is your belief that Mrs. Oswald received a copy of this
letter in Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she received a letter on this letterhead written in Russian.
Now whether it was an exact copy, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. About the length of this letter as far as you could tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At about the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, it was the same day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was the letter she crumpled up and put in the wastepaper
basket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But you retrieved it from the wastepaper basket, did you not
say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir, and asked her to answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where is that copy that you retrieved from the wastepaper
basket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Maybe reassigned to the wastepaper basket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It may have been, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe that was the letter that Mr. Redlich indicated
he would get a copy from the Dallas Chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Her answer is what he wanted to get.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I think Congressman Ford is right. We might be able to get
both a copy of the letter and their answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Their statement in this letter is the English of the Russian
translation which they sent to her. I think it would be adequate, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It seems to me it would be adequate for our purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We will contact the Dallas Division on that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Marina testified here, and she has said elsewhere, that
based on the facts as she now knows them, she believes that Lee was guilty of
the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was that her attitude when you first met her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, when I first met her, we didn't converse very well at all.
There was lack of communication because of the language barrier, and I didn't
discuss it with her probably until the latter part of December, although she
was speaking fairly good English by the 15th of December.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you first discussed it with her, what was her
attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she said she thought he was crazy.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But did she indicate when you first discussed the question
of guilt or not being guilty, what was her attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She thought he was guilty.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The first time you discussed the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she indicate why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I asked her why, and she said it was just a feeling.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At that point had <span class="locked">she&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. A woman's feeling.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At that point had she been given or shown the evidence
that had been accumulated by various agencies of the Federal Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know. I assume she had through the FBI. The FBI
were showing her pictures and numerous things. I was not in on any of the
questioning at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Had she read the papers or had them read to her as far as you
know at that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Some of them, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Newspapers, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From that first conversation you had with her about
this matter, the guilt of Lee Harvey Oswald, she has never changed her mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, and I have never heard her say anything other than he was
guilty.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever discuss with Marina the conversation she
had with Lee Harvey Oswald at the Dallas police station the day he was apprehended
or the day following. Or at any time prior to his death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The only time she said anything about it was that he told her
not to worry and to make sure and get the&mdash;get June a pair of shoes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She told you that is what he said to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That is what he said, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was nothing extraordinary that she told you
about the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Other than what you have indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. He said not to worry. Everything would be all right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever ask her about this conversation that she
had with Lee Harvey Oswald while he was at the Dallas police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As her manager, as the manager of Marina, did you
have anything to do with the change of her appearance? Many people have
said to me the first picture they saw of her and the subsequent pictures they
saw of her she was wearing different kind of clothes. She had a different
hair-do, and so forth. Did you have anything to do with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What was the purpose of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Just to change her general appearance so she wouldn't be recognized
when she went out.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she agree to this, was she willing to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. She didn't like her haircut particularly.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She liked the previous way it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How about the change in clothes, the type that she wore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, of course, that was for the better.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she like it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She liked the clothes, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She tried makeup but that didn't work, because she couldn't stand
makeup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We previously asked you, Mr. Martin, about various people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
that Marina Oswald knew in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and you have indicated
the extent to which you knew them personally and the extent to which they had
contacted Marina Oswald during the time she was in your home.</p>

<p>Are there any other friends of Marina Oswald's rather than those I have
asked you about that you&mdash;who attempted to contact her while she was living
at your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Ilya, I believe it is Mamatav or Mamantov&mdash;he is of the Dallas
Police Department and he has asked of her how she is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Has he ever seen her, to the best of your knowledge other than
in an official capacity?</p>

<p>(At this point, Congressman Ford left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, one time when we went to Sears, Sears Roebuck in Dallas,
and walked into the store he was walking and practically ran into her, and
they said hello and passed the time of day and he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. There were no other friends of hers that you know about who
attempted to see her or call her while she was living at your home?</p>

<p>Other than those we have already discussed on the record? If I mentioned
the name of Mr. or Mrs. Teofil Meller&mdash;the first name is Teofil, the last name
is Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, there was someone that called the office one day and had a
rather odd name, was that Meller, and said that Marina wanted to talk to her,
and we took it just for a crank call. She wouldn't leave the number or anything
like that. I am not sure whether that was Meller.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There was no telephone number involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You have discussed at length the attempt of Ruth Paine to
see Mrs. Oswald. Did Mike Paine ever attempt to see Mrs. Oswald while she
was living at your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you ever talked to Michael Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. When we went over to get the clothes, for instance, he stood
back&mdash;I don't believe he said anything at all. It was a very odd situation. He
was helping us move things but he didn't say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina ever discuss Michael Paine with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Only Ruth Paine but not Michael Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. She said they were separated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, did Marina ever discuss with you her husband's
desire to go to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said that he had wanted to go to Cuba because he wanted&mdash;because
he wasn't happy in Russia and he wasn't happy in the United States
and then she said he wouldn't be happy in Cuba either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she ever discuss with you a plan to hi-jack a plane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she ever indicate what steps he was taking to get to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. Not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have any knowledge at all of any plans he was making
to get to and live in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Ford has asked you about the conversations which Marina
had with Lee Oswald at the Dallas Police Station on November 23 and you have
replied. I would like to ask you about any&mdash;your knowledge about any conversation
which Robert Oswald had with Lee Oswald while he was in the custody of
the Dallas Police prior to his death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have no knowledge at all of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You have never had any conversations with Robert Oswald
concerning his conversations with Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you ever talked to Mrs. Marguerite Oswald concerning any
conversations which she had with her son while he was in the custody of the
Dallas police?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you had any conversations at all with Mrs. Marguerite
Oswald concerning the facts surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I don't think any direct conversation, I mean between she
and I. I was present at times out there at the Inn when she was talking to this
person or that person. But I don't believe I have had any direct conversation
with her at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Mrs. Marguerite Oswald ever discuss with you an incident
concerning a photograph which was supposed to have been shown to her by
agents of the FBI on November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I have heard that through news media but that is the only
place I heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You have no direct knowledge of that incident yourself. Did
Marina Oswald ever discuss that incident with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina Oswald ever discuss with you her mother-in-law's
allegations that Lee Oswald was acting as an agent of the United States
Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. She mentioned only one incident where the FBI came to
their house when they were in Oak Cliff, and they took him down to the car,
I believe he was about ready to sit down to dinner when they arrived, and they
took him down to the car and talked to him, and Marina was upset because
dinner was spoiling, and I think that is the only reference she has made to anything
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. She has never discussed with you the specific claims of Marguerite
Oswald in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. In the course of your conversations with Marina Oswald or
in the course of the preparation of any stories or releases on Mrs. Oswald's
behalf have you ever discussed with Mrs. Oswald the events of November 21
and the morning of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you relate those conversations to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He came home Thursday night, which was unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Just so the record is clear, I hope you are relating to us now
what Marina Oswald has related to you and not what you have read in any
publication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. And, let's see, this was sometime in December that she was
telling me this&mdash;no, I remember when it was, when she was moving from the
Inn to my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By the Inn you <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The Inn of the Six Flags. She was in the back seat and Leon
Gopadze was in the front seat talking with her, and she told him that he had
come home Thursday night and <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This was a conversation in Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Lee translated it for me, Gopadze translated it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Afterwards or as it took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. As it took place, well, it was immediately afterwards, and she
made a comment that he had left his wedding band on the dresser, I think, and
she got up the next morning she found his wedding band on the dresser, which
was strange.</p>

<p>Now, that is the only thing that relates to that period that I have heard her
say. Now, I didn't actually hear her say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You have had no other conversations with her with regard to
the period of November 21 and the morning of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have any knowledge of the story which Marina Oswald
prepared in Russian and which she has sent to this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you state the extent of your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I knew it was written, and written by her, and that is about
the extent of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Was it ever translated for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, we have part of it translated, a portion of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are there any parts of that story which you now believe to be
inaccurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I don't have the whole thing translated, but I think everything
that is translated, I have no reason to doubt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you assist Marina Oswald in the preparation for her television
appearance in January on CBS television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are there any portions of that interview which you now believe
to be inaccurate in any respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. We set a format for CBS to use, specific questions, and
Marina was not prompted as to the answers to give. Those were impromptu.
But we went over the ones with her off the camera, and asked her the questions
so that she would understand them, and then she answered them, and the second
time she did it on camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. To the best of your knowledge and recollection those answers
were accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I can't remember them. But none of them struck me as
<span class="locked">being&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Apart from the newspaper clippings which we went through
this morning and afternoon, are you familiar with any other narrative prepared
by or for Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Prepared by or for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. You mean other than newspaper articles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Other than the newspaper articles which we discussed this morning
and this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Life magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you have anything to do with the recent story in Life
magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, we had nothing on that other than the picture. Time magazine,
she was interviewed for Time magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Saturday&mdash;Friday&mdash;she was here in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. If I may refresh your recollection, she completed her testimony
before this Commission at approximately 5:30 on Thursday, February 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I believe it was Friday. We held a press conference on
Friday afternoon, and I think it was Friday night then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. It would be sometime after the completion of her testimony is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you with her during the course of that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It must have been Thursday night. It was Thursday night
because Secret Service was still with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You believe this interview took place on Thursday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That would be February 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you with her during the course of this interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Part of the time. I left John Thorne and Marina and the Time
reporter at the table. June was restless, and I was walking her around the
restaurant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you read the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are there any portions of it which you now believe to be inaccurate,
to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't think so. I would have to re-read it to make it definite,
make a definite statement on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. On the basis of conversations which you had during the course
of the testimony of Marina Oswald before this Commission and on the basis of
conversations which you have had subsequent to that time, do you have any
opinion concerning the truthfulness of the testimony which she presented before
this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I think primarily she is truthful, and I think that under
oath she would tell the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you still Mrs. Oswald's business representative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. According to the contract, yes. According to my contract with
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you received any communication from her which raises
questions as to whether you are still her business representative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Are we really concerned with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Chairman, I intend to ask the witness why he was discharged
in terms of whether it had anything to do with any business negotiations or anything
to do with the testimony of Mrs. Oswald before this Commission.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You can ask him if it has anything to do with her testimony.
We are not interested in her business affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I merely wanted to establish the fact <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. This thing can go on interminably with all this minutia and
things that don't bear on what we are here to find out, whatever his business
relations are with Mrs. Oswald, it seems to me is his business and not ours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald's attempt to terminate the relationship with
you relate in any way to her testimony before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. There was no reason given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did it relate in any way, in your opinion, to any information
which you may have given to anyone else with regard to your knowledge of the
facts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you tell us about your association with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it is a very minor association. I had been working in the
Statler Hotel in Dallas as assistant manager for maybe six months before I met
him, and met him through some of the other people in the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What year was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I just want to get the general area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. 1955 or 1956. And as a club manager, I was club manager in
Dallas also, and didn't associate with him at all, even on a bilateral communication
through the clubs. But it was just a nodding acquaintance, you might say.
I knew him by his first name. He knew me by my first name and we spoke
when we saw each other and I think I have been in his place twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall the approximate dates of those visits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, once in 1962. I had some gentlemen from New Orleans
with me. They were visiting Dallas on business at the Inn of the Six
Flags, and they wanted to see the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is what you mean by his place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. So I called Jack Ruby and asked if it would be all right
if I brought them down. We stayed approximately an hour and a half.</p>

<p>The other time was during the daytime, let's see, as it was then, I had&mdash;I
was walking in that area and just stopped in to say hello. The club was closed
at that time, not closed for business but it was before opening hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Those are the only times you have been in Jack Ruby's business
establishment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you consider yourself a friend of his?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. An acquaintance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you gone out socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. He came out to the Inn one time with some little gimmick.
It is called a Detwist Board. It is quite a piece of plywood about like this with
a round plate on the bottom of it, seated in ball bearings and you are supposed
to stand on this thing to twist, and came out to ask me to see who to ask at the
park to merchandise it, the Six Flags over Texas Amusement Park, and I told
him. Now, whether he went over there or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I understand that you have had a conversation with an aid
of General Walker concerning the General Walker incident.</p>

<p>Would you tell the Commission about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. They contacted <span class="locked">us&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who is "they"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. General Walker's aide, Mr. Moore or Morse, a tall thin gentleman,
about 55 or 60, and wanted actually an interview with Marina which we
didn't think was necessary.</p>

<p>They came out to John Thorne's office and we sat and talked. They were of
the opinion&mdash;what they were trying to do was find out who else was involved&mdash;this
was right after the announcement was made in the paper about Lee Oswald
shooting at Walker. They were trying to find out who else was involved because
General Walker is still in fear of his life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This was some time before the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, it was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. After November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir. This was after the announcement was made in the
paper <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That Lee Oswald had attacked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The actual attack was in April. This was after the newspaper
announcement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. After the newspaper announcements that Lee had tried to
kill him which was after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. And they just wanted verification actually that or to try to get
verification as to how many people were involved, and we told them that there was
just one person involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At the time did you ask Marina about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And this is what she told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The persons involved in the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. She said that Lee did it alone without any help. There
was no one with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I have at this time no further questions other than
those which may be suggested by a perusal of the records which you have forwarded
to this Commission.</p>

<p>As we indicated in the brief recess earlier, Mr. Dulles is able to be here at 9
o'clock this evening, and I would envisage then a very brief session at which time
your testimony would be completed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are there any questions that anyone would like to ask of Mr.
Martin at this time?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Would you like to ask your client any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. No. I am not going to make that mistake.</p>

<p>(Laughter.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have no questions. I will reserve them for tonight. I don't
think I have any further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Rhyne, do you have any questions you would like to ask.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Mr. Rankin, are you through for the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Until 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well then, gentlemen, we will adjourn until
9 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:15 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<h2><span class="smaller"><a name="Evening_Session" id="Evening_Session">Evening Session</a></span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF JAMES HERBERT MARTIN RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 9:20 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Committee will come to order.</p>

<p>Will you continue with the testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Thank you, Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, at our last session I asked you whether you knew Jack Ruby, and
you replied that you did. You indicated the brief contact that you have had
with him and the two times, I believe, that you have been to his business
establishment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Apart from your own personal contact with Jack Ruby, do you
have any other information about him and his activities which you would like
to present before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, nothing that I definitely know about him. It is just he is a
city character. He is very friendly to everyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Please understand I am not asking you for rumors or that type
of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I know. Well, just what I know of him, he seems very
friendly to everyone, and he is always around. You are liable to see him
anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Has he ever been to the motel that you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, I mentioned that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He brought that twist board out there one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Never been there as a guest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I hand you a copy of an invoice for a Revere recorder and a
1,200-foot reel of recording tape, and ask you if you have ever seen this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. That is a tape recorder that I rented and recorded <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I will ask you about it shortly. I would just like to know if
you are familiar with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Chairman, I am marking this as Commission Exhibit No.
332, and ask that it be admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any objection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The tape recorder and tape invoice referred to were marked Commission's
Exhibit No. 332 for identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 332, and ask
you to tell the Commission the conditions under which this invoice arose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. We had Marina's manuscript interpreted by Ilya Mamantov,
and this was part of it. He was only able to interpret about half of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. He interpreted it and put it on tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. And we recorded that on tape as he interpreted it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How do you mean interpreted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He read it in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Oh, I see, translated it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. From Russian into English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When I asked you this afternoon about your knowledge as to
the accuracy of that story, I take it your reply was based upon this translation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And this only encompasses about half of the entire story, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It is more than half, it is about 15 pages, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she consult with you at all in the preparation of that story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And there is nothing on this tape other than the English translation
of that Russian story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do we have that translation as well as the copy of the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes, Mr. Chairman, we have the original in Russian and then
it was translated by Mr. Gopadze, of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Actually our translation is very poor. He was not able to
translate properly into English a lot of the phrases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who is "he," Illa? Isn't that Ilya, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is generally the Russian, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. But he is professor at SMU. He has a list of titles that long.
He is very well thought of. I think he works for Sun Oil Company, and is a
well-respected individual. His wife and his mother, I believe, teach Russian
also. I think his mother taught Mrs. Paine a good deal of her Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I would like to show you Commission Exhibit No.
325 which was introduced earlier today. Mr. Leech, I believe you have a
photostat of this. If you could hand it to me during the course of this questioning.
I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Could you tell the Commission what this document purports to state, and
then I will ask you about individual items.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. These are contracts that we have made both in writing and
verbally for Marina Oswald's right, her story rights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And the first item appearing on Commission Exhibit No. 325
is a contract with Texitalia Films.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you describe the terms and conditions of that contract?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Texitalia Films is planning a 60-minute technicolor documentary
to start. They will pay $75,000 for World-Wide movie and the TV rights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Excuse me, is this a documentary of Marina's life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Any movie or television appearances Marina would be
paid $7,500 plus expenses for each appearance. Then for each personal appearance,
for instance, the film opens in St. Louis on such and such a date and they
would like for her to be there to make a personal appearance for the showing,
the opening of the film, she would receive $1,500 plus expenses for each public
appearance of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And this contract according to this exhibit was signed on
February 11, 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. By her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, by me acting for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By you acting on behalf of Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, in accordance with my contract with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The second item appearing here is a contract with Life magazine.
Would you tell the Commission about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Life magazine purchased the rights, North American rights on
a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald with a rifle and pistol, primarily for their
use on a cover issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is what appeared on the recent cover issue, I guess, it
was 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Now, that $5,000 has been paid. We have the $5,000 in an escrow account.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you actually have in your possession the photograph, a
copy of which appeared on the cover of Life magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us how this contract was consummated, in view
of the fact that Life magazine apparently printed on its cover a photograph
which you never possessed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. They knew the photographs belonged to Marina. They have
a common law copyright, and the only way they could legally use the film is
to purchase the rights from Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Life magazine indicate to you where they obtained the
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you had conversations with other publications concerning
that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I made the contact with the London Daily Mirror for the
purchase of the British Commonwealth rights on that same photograph, and
they guaranteed $2,200 plus 50&ndash;50 split on what they sold in the Commonwealth.
It was restricted to the Commonwealth only.</p>

<p>However, the London Daily Mail came out with the photograph prior to the
Mirror, and I was informed by Mr. Weggand of the London Daily Express that
the Detroit Free Press had sold this photograph to the London Daily Mail for
$500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have any idea how the Detroit Free Press obtained this
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I talked to Ken Murray, who I was informed was the attorney
for the Detroit Free Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Where did you talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At his home in Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. By telephone. And he stated that the photograph was public
property, and not covered under common law copyright. I asked him where
he got the photo, and he said he got it at the same place as Life did, through
a leak in the Commission. I talked to Life magazine attorney&mdash;I can't remember
his name. It is a very odd name. It begins with an "S". Now, Murray
said that Life had informed him that they had gotten it from a leak through
the Commission, and I contacted Life and he denied saying anything of the
sort to Murray.</p>

<p>However, Murray insisted that that is where he got that and he figured it
was public domain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At the start of today's testimony when you mentioned the
possibility of a leak with regard to this photograph, something that you said
prior to the actual start of hearings, Mr. Rankin and I commented on that
assertion.</p>

<p>Would you tell the Commission what we said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That there was definitely not a leak in the Commission, and
that you would certainly find out what Murray was talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you talk to an editor of the Detroit Free Press with regard
to this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I called at night. It was at night, and I asked for the news
editor. He was not in, so I talked to a reporter, and he couldn't say anything
about it. He referred me to Ken Murray and gave me his home telephone
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The next item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 has reference
to Stern Magazine.</p>

<p>Would you tell the Commission about that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Stern Magazine we have been working with since the middle
of December. They have been quite patient actually. For $12,500 they wanted
Marina's memoirs and photographs, available photographs for use in Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and Italy only. They wanted exclusive use in those two countries. Then they
would endeavor to sell these same memoirs and pictures to other European
countries, limiting it only to European countries, and take a 30 percent commission
on any sales that they made, the remaining 70 percent going to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Has this contract been signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you know when it was signed? Can you approximate
the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I confirmed it by wire to them. It is in the exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We have not <span class="locked">introduced&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. You haven't come to that yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We do not intend to introduce the specific documents into the
record, just this summary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Give him an approximate date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You say it was confirmed by telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, it was confirmed by telegram to Spiegelberg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. In New York. December 16 at 2:45 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The next item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 also refers to
Stern Magazine, an item of $2,650.</p>

<p>Could you comment on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. This was a recent development wherein since they could not
send an author in to talk to Marina, they purchased seven photographs for a
total of $2,650, to take the memoirs later.</p>

<p>However, they will not hold off the memoirs forever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. These seven photographs are photographs of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald together and separate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. These were photographs which were not turned over to the
Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. They were photographs that we were given prints of
by the FBI. The FBI sent prints of these photographs to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Am I correct in assuming that all of the photographs which
were in the possession of Marina Oswald and Lee Harvey Oswald, either in
his apartment or in the Paine's apartment, were turned over to the Dallas
police?</p>

<p>Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. As far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. To the best of your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And that any photographs which you have and which have
been the basis of any contract are copies which were made available to you
by some law enforcement authority?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Now, there was a check, there was a $250 cash down
payment made on this $2,650. Then a check for $2,400; the check was stopped,
payment on the check was stopped because of a letter written by William
McKenzie saying that I had no authority to sign any contracts whatsoever
for Marina, and that if they did use anything that I had sold them, litigation
would follow immediately. So consequently they stopped payment on the
check. I still have the check. It is still attached to the letter that was sent
with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask who is that check made out to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Made out to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. To you as agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or to you just in your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think it is just made out to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't know if it is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. You go ahead and I'll find it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Under the contract all checks were supposed to be made payable
to me. Then I would deduct my fee and forward the balance to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The next item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 refers to Meredith
Press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The Meredith Press is a book publisher with their main
office in Des Moines, Iowa. I had talked with Mr. Ted Purdy at great
length and on numerous occasions by phone. We had negotiated world book
rights for Marina Oswald's story. For this Meredith Press would pay a $25,000
advance to her. Then on the first printing would be a 10 percent commission
of the retail price of the book.</p>

<p>On the second printing would be 12½ percent commission, and on the third
and succeeding printings it would be 15 percent commission.</p>

<p>Now, of course, the commissions were to be deducted from the advance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And this was to be her life story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Had you discussed with Marina at all the contents of this
book? Had you started making any preparations for writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I am not a writer, and wouldn't know the first thing to
do about a book. But we had negotiated with one writer, Isaac Don Levine,
who Meredith Press felt would be the best writer available for this type of
book because of the Russian attachment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you told us this morning of your initial concern over the
Nixon shooting incident, did it relate to these various agreements that you
have been working on concerning the sale of Marina Oswald's story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Did it relate to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. How do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you concerned about the publicity, the effect of the publicity
of the Nixon incident on these various agreements which you were negotiating
at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. As a matter of fact, it would enhance the price of it.</p>

<p>For instance, the Post magazine, the Saturday Evening Post, said that they
would like to buy American serial rights if there was something in Marina's
story that the Commission did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When did they tell you this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Around the first of the year I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Around the first of the year. Did Marina know about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. This is the Saturday Evening Post you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I talked to a Mr. Black.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And the Saturday Evening Post said to you that they would buy
the serial rights provided there was some information which would not be
known to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I told them there was no realm that would apply, and
we closed negotiations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And you say you didn't relate this fact at all to Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. These negotiations with the Post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Was there in fact to the best of your knowledge material which
she did not in fact relate to this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to my knowledge other than the Nixon affair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And were you aware at the time she completed her testimony
here that she had not related this information to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Was there any connection between her failure to tell the Commission
of the Nixon incident and the negotiations, the temporary negotiations
that you had had with the Saturday Evening Post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, none whatsoever. That was closed off at least 30 days before
she testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Was there any attempt on your part or anyone acting on
Marina Oswald's part that you know of to negotiate the sale of the information
concerning the Nixon shooting incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When Marina&mdash;did Marina ever give you an explanation for
why she did not tell the Commission about the Nixon incident?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I have never talked to her about that other than the first
time that she told me about it. I asked John Thorne if she had mentioned it.
I didn't discuss it with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And since Marina Oswald's return from Washington after
having testified here, you say you have never discussed the Nixon incident
with Marina Oswald in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I probably would have had there been sufficient time.
Of course, she left my home the following day after she got back from Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you say you probably would have, in what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, since she didn't mention it to the Commission, I feel the
Commission should know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know at this time she had not mentioned it to the
Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I asked John Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Oh, you asked John Thorne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did John Thorne say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Said she had not mentioned it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ask John Thorne why she had not mentioned it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did John Thorne offer any information as to why she had
not mentioned it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you know whether John Thorne had urged her to mention it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. John Thorne was aware of the Nixon incident prior to Marina
Oswald's appearance before this Commission, was he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Because you had apparently told him about that shortly after
you learned about it in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you discuss the Nixon incident with Robert Oswald after
Marina Oswald's appearance before this Commission in February?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You had not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know if I discussed it with him prior to the Commission's
testimony or not. I may or I may not have. I don't know. I don't know
whether I mentioned it to him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Coming back to Commission Exhibit No. 325, the next item
under London Daily Mirror, am I correct in assuming that this is, that this
item refers to the rifle photo which you discussed earlier in your testimony
tonight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have anything to add with regard to that rifle photo
that you have not already told us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you discuss with Marina Oswald at any time this rifle photo
and the circumstances under which it was taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I asked her at one time why he wanted a photograph taken of
that type, and she said she didn't know. He just wanted pictures taken that
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she tell you when this photograph was taken in relationship
to any other incidents such as the General Walker incident or the Richard Nixon
incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you know where the photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know, I don't even know if it was in Oak Cliff or not.
I have an idea that it was in Oak Cliff but I don't know whether I know that or
whether I have read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you say Oak Cliff, some of us don't live in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It is a suburb of Dallas, a section of Dallas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you referring to the area where the Neely Street house
was located?</p>

<p>To refresh your recollection, Mr. Martin, the Oswalds lived in two places in
Dallas. One was on Elsbeth Street and the other on Neely. Are they both
in Oak Cliff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, Elsbeth Street is right around the corner from Neely Street,
I believe they lived in an apartment on Elsbeth.</p>

<p>It was a group of apartments in one building, and on Neely Street, I think,
that was similar to a duplex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And you are not certain as to where this photograph which
was the subject of these negotiations was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, except that the Elsbeth address, I believe, was a brick residence,
I mean a brick apartment, it is a dark building, and the Neely Street
address is a white building.</p>

<p>I believe the photo shows a white building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. On the basis of that you would conclude the photograph was
taken at which address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At the Neely Street address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At the Neely Street address. When you were negotiating with
various publications for this photograph, didn't anyone ask you when and
where it was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, I told them that it was while they were living in Oak
Cliff. I didn't say where or when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. No one asked you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. And they apparently weren't concerned with the where or when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did they ask you anything about the publication which Lee
Oswald had in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, and I told them that it was either the Militant or the
Worker. I was not sure which one. I am not even sure whether either one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Your copy of the photograph did not indicate clearly which one
it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you now know which one it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are you sure it is one of the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I am not. I assume that it would be one of the two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. For the record it is the Militant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Is there anything about the circumstances of this photograph,
including the rifle, the pistol, the time, the place, anything concerning this
photograph that you have not told this Commission about which you have
knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The last item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 is This Week
magazine, $1,000. Could you tell us about that. At the conclusion of this list
I will ask if there is anything else. We are now at This Week magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. When Marina was here in Washington, she had the press conference,
and at the end of the press conference she mentioned, she made a
statement "Now I go to church." On the way to the CBS studios we passed
a Russian Orthodox Church, and she remarked about it, that she would like
to come back and go inside, see what it looked like. Someone in This Week
magazine caught that statement, and wanted to write a short article on Marina
going to church, and that is what that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What happened? Could you tell us how this article got written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It hasn't been written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did the reporter accompany Mrs. Oswald to church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, no. Actually when the television interview was over, we
came back and went to the church, but the church was locked and we didn't
get in at all. Now this contact was made after we left Washington. This Week
magazine contacted us after, not while we were still here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And what was the subject matter of this article specifically
supposed to be?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The title of it was supposed to be "I go to church," and it would
be an article written on Marina going to church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, the total figure on the bottom of Commission Exhibit
No. 325 is $132,350. This presumably does not include any future royalties, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you made an estimate as to the total earnings which
would accrue as a result of these contractual arrangements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It should be approximately $300,000 at a maximum, depending
on what American serial rights and British Commonwealth serial rights, Asiatic
serial rights would bring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You say the maximum of $300,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Of those contracts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That is what I am asking about are these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of these contracts, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us about any other contractual arrangements
that you have made or are negotiating on behalf of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There are no others. I will have to refer to things. We had an
offer from Australia and also from New Zealand as far as this photograph is
concerned. However, it was thrown to the wind by the Detroit Free Press, so
they got it from Detroit Free Press, we have been offered&mdash;we have not received
an offer. The Australian <span class="locked">newspaper&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you need these details do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I want to get the total figure, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Associated Newspapers Limited of Australia would like to have
Australian rights to a book that Marina would write, and also the London
Evening Standard would like to have the British rights, of course, to the picture
of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, Mr. Thorne has indicated to this Commission that
he estimated that Marina's earnings would approach approximately $500,000.
Would you comment on that estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think it might be a little high. Of course, if you take into
consideration she has $68,000, close to $70,000 in contributions alone, then the
advances on this Exhibit No. 325, that is $200,000 right there. I think $500,000
might be just a little bit high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The final document I would like to show you is a photostat of
a letter which you presented to the Commission today, purporting to be a letter
written in Russian together with an English translation. It starts, the English
translation starts with the words "As the widow of Lee Oswald." I show you
Commission Exhibit No. 333 and ask you if this is a photostat of the letter
which you submitted to the Commission this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, apparently so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who is that letter to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We don't know yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You don't know yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I will develop that in the questioning. I mark this Commission
Exhibit No. 333, being a Russian letter and what purports to be its English
translation and ask that it be admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Can you identify that any further than just a Russian letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. On the top appears a date, and the day of the month is the 20th.
I am unable to tell what month it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. But the year is 1964, and the words "Dallas, Texas" then appear
under the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That helps identify it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I ask that it be admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any objection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. No objection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It is admitted.</p>

<p>(The photostats of a Russian letter with an English translation were marked
Commission Exhibit No. 333 for identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, with your permission I would just summarize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
contents of this letter, and if I have summarized it inaccurately, just say so.
This letter requests that the death penalty not be applied to Jack Ruby, the
person who has been charged with the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. Is that
inaccurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That is a correct summary of the contents of the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall to whom that letter was written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She originally wrote the letter to Melvin Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By "she" you mean Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Marina. I advised her <span class="locked">against&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Melvin Belli?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Is the attorney for Jack Ruby. I advised her against such an
action, because of the possibility of the letter itself in translating from Russian
to English being misinterpreted and used in a manner that might be derogatory
to Marina Oswald. I suggested that she send this letter to Henry Wade who
would be the prosecutor in the case. Now whether she changed the salutation
on the letter I don't know. I can't read Russian. And the salutation was not
translated in the translation. The translation was made by Katya Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. To the best of your knowledge has this letter ever been sent
to anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No sir, it hasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You say it has not been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It has not been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is your belief or you have knowledge that it has not been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have the original. Now if a letter has been sent, it would be a
different letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. On the basis of your knowledge of Marina Oswald's handwriting,
would you tell the Commission whether you believe that this letter is in
her handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, it is. I also observed her writing the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you aware of the fact that Marina Oswald discussed this
letter when she appeared before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe you mentioned it sometime today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you aware of it prior to your coming here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you know why it has not been sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She decided that it was best not to be sent unless she actually
thought that Ruby was going to get the death penalty. Actually a letter like
that should go to the Governor of the State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, do you have any additional information concerning
the assassination of President Kennedy, Marina Oswald, or the assassination of
her husband Lee Harvey Oswald which you would like to present before this
Commission at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I don't think so. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. If it would be helpful for the work of this Commission for
you to return to Washington and appear again before this Commission, would
you be willing to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions of this witness, unless
Mr. Rankin does or you do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I would just like to ask a question about this letter I am just
glancing over. Where did this letter paper come from? Is that some personal
paper with a tree on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I bought that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You bought it for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At a drug store, yes, sir, at a drug store in Arlington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is this another draft or is this just a copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. This is the original of the copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We have photographed what is now Commission Exhibit No.
333 and we are keeping the photostat. Mr. Martin, you will recall that at the
start of today's proceedings Chief Justice Warren read into the record a copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
of the letter which you received requesting certain notes, records, documents in
connection with today's hearing. Have you made available to the Commission
all of the material which was requested in that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I went through everything I had at home, and could
find nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. If you should find anything else which you inadvertently failed
to bring before this Commission, will you mail it to us for examination and we
will return it to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; there is a Worker that I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You mean by Worker the Daily Worker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.   I think they dropped the "Daily."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They are no longer daily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It is called the Worker now. It has quite a lengthy article about
Marina in it, and I will send that to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And you will send anything that you may come across which you
may have inadvertently failed to produce before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There were some questions that Senator Cooper had suggested.
I don't know, have you looked those over? Have they been covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Those have been covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All been covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did Marina ever express to you her opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of her husband in connection with the assassination of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She believes he was guilty. She believes he did it, and the first
time she said it I questioned her as to why she thought he did it, and she said
she just felt it. It was a woman's intuition. She didn't know the word intuition
at that time. I had to look it up in the Russian-English Dictionary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she indicate any view as to whether he did it alone or had
an accomplice or accomplices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She remarked about the Walker incident, that that was definitely
done alone, and that he always was alone. He never did anything with anyone
else. I don't recall that she mentioned that specifically in the case of the
assassination of the President. But she had made that remark before or during
the interim about Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she ever at any time express to you any interest in returning
to the Soviet Union or her desire to stay in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she has always said that she wanted to stay in the United
States. One time she said that she thought she would go back to Russia, and
I asked her why and she said, well, she was just joking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she ever refer to you any letters she wrote to the Soviet
Embassy with regard to a desire to return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. There was only one incident that she told me about was a
letter to a friend in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You mentioned that I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The one that she didn't put enough stamps on, enough postage on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, it came back "insufficient postage."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she ever mention to you any names of any friends or associates
of her husband that had not been discussed here at one time or another
in this testimony, including the list of names that was read out to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know any other friends that Marina has other than those
that have been discussed in this testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I was trying to think a while ago about that, and I can't
think of anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is all I have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Leech, would you like to ask Mr. Martin any questions at
this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Not a word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Rhyne? Mr. Rankin, have you any further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I merely wish to thank him for appearing
voluntarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I do thank you for coming and responding so fully to our
questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Anything I can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And if anything occurs to you or to your counsel as sometimes
happens later, we will be very glad if you or your counsel will bring it to our
attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I certainly will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. May I before we adjourn ask another question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Have you ever discussed with Mrs. Marguerite Oswald the question
of the guilt or innocence of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. The only time I was in contact with Marguerite Oswald
was at the Inn of the Six Flags in Arlington, Tex., and I don't believe I really
discussed anything with her. I was more on the sidelines and didn't enter into
any discussions with her at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And have you discussed with Robert Oswald the question of the
guilt or innocence of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Let's see, on one occasion the article by Mark Lane, I think
it was in the National Observer, was printed in the National Observer, and I
called Robert's attention to that. I believe he cited 15 points where he believed
that Lee Oswald was innocent, and I remarked to Robert that in nearly 100 percent
of those points they were just completely out of line. The brief I believe
was taken from newspaper accounts, from various newspaper accounts of the
assassination, and a number of them contradicted each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Robert Oswald comment on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. For the record I believe the publication you are referring to is
the National Guardian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The National Guardian, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Is that your recollection now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, National Guardian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And Robert Oswald had no comment on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Commission will stand adjourned, subject to call.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 10:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MARK LANE</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 2:30 p.m., on March 4, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman
Cooper and Representative Gerald R. Ford, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant
counsel; Charles Murray and Charles Rhyne, assistants to Walter E. Craig.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>The Commission has been informed that Mr. Lane has collected numerous
materials relevant to the Commission's work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
The Commission proposes to question Mr. Lane on all matters of which he has
knowledge concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
killing of Lee Harvey Oswald, and to request of Mr. Lane that he make
available to the Commission any documentary material in his possession which
can assist the Commission in its work.</p>

<p>In accordance with the rules of this Commission, Mr. Lane has been furnished
with a copy of this statement.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane, would please rise and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Will you be seated, please.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin, would you proceed with the examination, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Lane, will you state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. My name is Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. 164 West 79th Street, New York City, New York State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you a practicing lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you state your age, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I am 37 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long have you been practicing law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Thirteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have qualified in the State of New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you qualified in any other Jurisdiction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Just in the Federal court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have some information concerning the matters being
investigated by the Commission that you would like to present to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you proceed to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>I wonder if I might ask at the outset if I will be able to secure a copy
of the transcript of my testimony tomorrow, or is that going to be rushing
things?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You will be able to obtain it. I don't know whether we can
promise it to you tomorrow morning or not. But we will do it just as quickly
as it can be transcribed by the reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>At the outset, I would like to request that this portion of the hearing, in any
event, be opened to the public. I think that there are matters here of grave
concern to all the people of our country, and that it would, therefore, be fruitful
and constructive for the sessions to be conducted in a public fashion, open
to the public and to the press.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I request that this session at least involving my testimony be
so opened to the public.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You would have a right, as any witness would have, to
request that, Mr. Lane. We will conduct this in an open hearing. We will
adjourn at this time to the auditorium downstairs, and we will conduct the
hearing there. It will be open to the public. I saw a good many members
of the press around, so it will really be a public affair.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 2:45 p.m., the Commission recessed and then reconvened in the
auditorium in open session.)</p>

<p>Mr. Lane has stated that he would like to give his testimony at a public hearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
I explained to him that that was thoroughly agreeable to the Commission.
The Commission does not operate in a secret way. Any witness who desires
to have his&mdash;give his testimony in public may do so.</p>

<p>We have done it in the quiet of our rooms for the convenience of witnesses,
and in order to accelerate the program. But any witness who desires to have
his testimony recorded at a public hearing may do so.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Commission is, of course, eventually to make known to
the President, and to the American public everything that has transpired before
this Commission. All of it will be made available at the appropriate time.
The records of the work of the Commission will be preserved for the public. So,
Mr. Lane, we will be happy to accommodate you, and to proceed with our
hearing.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Rankin will conduct the examination.</p>

<p>(Having been previously duly sworn.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Lane, will you proceed to tell the Commission whatever
you have that would bear upon this investigation? Start item by item, and
give us whatever you have in support.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>At the outset, I would like to call to the Commission's attention a matter
which is somewhat peripheral, perhaps, and should the Commission determine
it does not wish to hear my testimony in that regard, I will understand that.
But I would like to call it to your attention, because although it is peripheral
I think it is related to both the assassination and the investigation into the
assassination of the President.</p>

<p>That is in relationship to a picture which has been widely publicized,
probably in every single community of our country, allegedly showing Lee
Harvey Oswald holding in his hand a rifle which has been described in at least
one publication, Life magazine, as the weapon with which he assassinated
President Kennedy.</p>

<p>I would like to indicate to the Commission at this time that the pictures which
have been distributed throughout the country included doctored and forged
photographs. I would like to present evidence to the Commission at this time
in that regard.</p>

<p>I ask the Commission if it does conclude that the photographs have been
doctored, whether it will consider determining whether or not a crime has
been committed, or an effort has been made to submit evidence to the Commission
members, though not directly through the press, from magazines, which
<span class="locked">evidence&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I didn't get that last sentence&mdash;something about the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I am asking the Commission if it does conclude that the pictures
have been doctored, to consider investigating the method by which the doctoring
took place, who was responsible, and whether or not an effort has been made to
influence the members of the Commission, while not directly, through the publication
of this picture, which certainly has been circulated very widely throughout
our country.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be sure, Mr. Lane, that anything you present in
that regard will be thoroughly considered by the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>I would like to offer the February 21, 1964 issue of Life magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you mark that, Mr. Reporter, please, the next number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. A picture appears on the entire cover of Life magazine, and an
identical picture appears in the interior pages, at page 80. The caption on the
cover reads, "Lee Oswald with the weapons he used to kill President Kennedy
and Officer Tippit."</p>

<p>I think it is quite plain from looking at both of the pictures that there appears
on the rifle, what appears to be a rifle in the left hand of Lee Harvey Oswald,
a telescopic sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Lane, we will mark that Exhibit No. 334.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 334, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Next I would like to offer a picture which is a glossy 8½-by-11<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
picture, of a photograph published in the New York Times, secured by the New
York Times from the Associated Press.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is there any verification of the fact that that is as you
have identified it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That is what&mdash;a picture <span class="locked">secured&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From the New York Times, which in turn had acquired
it from the Associated Press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, that is a statement which I have made under oath, and it
can be verified with the New York Times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 335 that you are just referring to, Mr. Lane.</p>

<p>(The document referred to  was marked Commission Exhibit No. 335, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I suggest that is the identical picture with the one published on
the cover of Life magazine, Exhibit 334, in every respect, including the creases
in the trousers, the background, with the exception of the rifle in the hands of
Oswald, which appears to have no telescopic scope in Exhibit 335.</p>

<p>In addition, there clearly has been some other doctoring of the photograph
around the head of Lee Harvey Oswald, and the trees and other background
material over his left shoulder have been removed from the Associated Press
picture, but are present in the Life magazine picture.</p>

<p>Shadows and fenceposts which can be observed between the legs of Lee Harvey
Oswald in Exhibit 335 have been removed in the Life magazine picture. I
would like to offer this picture as the next exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That will be marked Exhibit 336.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 336 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us what that is, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; 336 is an 8½-by-11 glossy photograph of a picture appearing
in Newsweek magazine, March 2, 1964, credited by Newsweek magazine to the
Detroit Free Press. I would suggest that that is an identical picture with the
other two pictures in every respect, except that it has no telescopic sight on
the rifle, and there is a great deal of metallic materials present on that rifle
clearly not present in the other two pictures.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did you say metallics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Metallics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us what you mean by that, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. Just below the hand, the left hand of Lee Harvey Oswald,
there is clearly visible a series of pieces of metal, allegedly part of the rifle,
which are in no way clear&mdash;which are in no way present in the other pictures.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. To make that clearer, I would like to offer Exhibit 337, which is
an enlargement of the picture 335, the New York Times picture.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 337, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This enlarges the area on the rifle just below what is allegedly
Oswald's left hand. It clearly shows an absolute absence of all of the metallic
material present in the Newsweek photo, 336.</p>

<p>This is a front page of the New York Journal American dated February 18,
1964, which is an identical picture with the one published in Life magazine,
Exhibit 334, and the credit lines appearing on that publication indicate that the
picture has been secured from the Associated Press through the Detroit Free
Press.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 338, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That picture has a telescopic sight, and is not the picture in terms
of the metal material on the rifle which Newsweek stated they secured through
the Detroit Free Press, and is not the picture without the telescopic sight which
the New York Times states that it secured through the Associated Press. In any
event, I would like to submit a picture procured from Worldwide Photos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 339.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 339, for
identification.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This is allegedly a picture taken in the Dallas Police Station,
showing the alleged murder weapon.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is No. 339, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir, and I would call the Commission's attention to the curved
line of the stock present in Exhibit 339, and obviously absent from every other
picture, indicating that in no event is the rifle allegedly in the hands of Lee
Oswald, in Exhibits 334 through 338 comparable to the alleged murder weapon
as shown in the Dallas police station.</p>

<p>And should the Commission decide to investigate the obviously doctored
pictures that have been circulated so widely in our country, I would refer the
Commission investigators to the Times Picayune of New Orleans, published
on November 24, 1963, in which an Associated Press story indicated that the
Dallas police chief, Jesse Curry, stated that he had in his possession photographs
found in the home of Lee Harvey Oswald's Russian-born wife which
linked Oswald with the rifle used in the assassination of President Kennedy.
Curry said in the article attributed to <span class="locked">Curry&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you wish to make that a part of the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That will be Exhibit 340.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 340 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The article attributes a statement to Curry indicating that he,
the Dallas Police Chief, found the pictures in the suburban Irving, Tex., home
in which Marina Oswald lived, and stated that Mr. Curry had said that the
pictures will be used in evidence in Oswald's murder trial. This was published,
I assume, prior to the time that Oswald was himself killed on that day.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would the date of the paper be on the back side?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It is on the front. November 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I would like to offer this as an exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is marked Commission Exhibit 341.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 341, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Exhibit 341 is a page or portion of a page of the New York Times,
on Sunday, December 8, with a picture of the alleged murder weapon, secured,
according to the credit line under the picture, from the United Press International,
indicating clearly that that rifle is not the rifle allegedly being held
by Mr. Oswald in any of the pictures so widely circulated throughout our
country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On what do you base that last conclusion, Mr. Lane? Would
you point out to the Commission the differences as you see them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; the reference of the stock. The stock has a clearly curved
and bent line in this picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is in Exhibit 341?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, and it is present in none of the pictures of Oswald holding
the rifle; 336, for example, in Newsweek magazine shows almost a straight
stock. Some of them show even an absolutely straight stock.</p>

<p>Exhibit 335 from the New York Times shows a perfectly straight stock&mdash;which
is not only a stock unlike this particular Italian 6.5 millimeter carbine, but
is a stock I believe unlike any rifle stock produced during the 20th century, and
possibly the 19th century, anywhere. Rifle experts seem to agree that every
stock must have in it some break, so that it is possible to place your hand around
the rifle while your finger holds the trigger. And there is no break in the
doctored photographs, in the stock portrayed on the doctored photographs.</p>

<p>I have checked many rifle catalogs. This is not my field, and I don't qualify
as an expert. But I have checked many rifle catalogs, and have only seen
rifles with a break where the stock becomes narrow enough for one's hand to
grasp it while pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that the basis of your opinion that you have just given, that
it doesn't have a break in it, and that other rifles for any period later than
you have described do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, several persons who have described themselves as rifle experts
have made that statement to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who are those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I believe I have some of their names here. I don't have the
names of those who have called, but I can secure that at our first break by a
telephone call to my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you furnish that then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Surely. In any event, whether there was another rifle or not,
the rifle portrayed in the picture is clearly&mdash;in the picture in which Oswald is
allegedly holding the rifle&mdash;clearly is not the rifle allegedly claimed to be the
murder weapon. I wonder if I might ask the Commission if it might produce
the rifle now, so that we might compare the actual rifle with the pictures.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will do that in due course. But we don't have the rifle
here now, Mr. Lane. We will make the proper comparisons, you may be sure,
with experts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Now, on another peripheral matter&mdash;unless there are any further
questions in relation to this <span class="locked">matter&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No, you may proceed. Do you have negatives of these pictures
you have produced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No. I am glad you asked that question, because I can now relate
to you about a conversation that I had 2 or 3 days ago with a Mr. Dirksen,
who is on the photo desk of the Associated Press. I called Mr. Dirksen and
asked him for a glossy of the picture which the Associated Press sent out over
the wire service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you identify Mr. Dirksen a little more clearly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He just told me he was employed. I called the Associated Press
in New York City and asked for the photo desk, Mr. Dirksen answered and
said he was employed there. I asked him what his specific position was there,
and he declined to give me that information. He said he didn't think it was
relevant.</p>

<p>In any event, I asked him if he could secure for me a glossy, a glossy copy
of the picture sent by the Associated Press over the wires. And I described
the picture as the one of Oswald allegedly holding the murder weapon in his left
hand, and having on his right hip a pistol, allegedly the pistol with which he
slew Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. Dirksen stated to me that he could not make a glossy of that picture
available to me and I pointed out to him that in the past the Associated Press
had been most cooperative when I asked for pictures, and he said, "Yes, we
sent a whole batch up to you last week, didn't we?" I said, "Yes, you did, I
appreciated that. I wonder why this picture is being treated differently from
other pictures." He said, "This is not a normal picture and this is not the
normal situation."</p>

<p>I asked him what he meant by that. He explained that there was a special
contract&mdash;he did not have all the details, he said, because he is not one of the
persons who was involved in drafting the contract&mdash;but there was a special
contract between the Associated Press and the source of this picture, and they
agreed, the Associated Press agreed in this contract that they would not make
a glossy available to anyone, that they would send the pictures out only to
their subscribers, and that no one else would be allowed to see the picture.</p>

<p>I said if that was the understanding, I certainly would not wish to have them
breach their agreement, and asked if instead he would make the name of the
source known to me, so that I might go directly to the source and see if I might
secure the picture in that fashion. He stated he could not do that, because one
of the other stipulations in the contract would be that they could not reveal the
name of the source of the picture.</p>

<p>I discussed this with an employee of the New York Times thereafter, since I
knew that the New York Times was a subscriber to the services made available
by the Associated Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you identify that employee, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, I am not going to be able to discuss sources, obviously, here,
I am sorry.</p>

<p>But this employee indicated to me thereafter that an inquiry had been made
by the New York Times to the Associated Press along the same lines as the
inquiry which I had made, in terms of trying to determine the source of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Associated Press picture. And I was informed by this employee of the New
York Times that the Associated Press declined to name the source of the picture,
even when the New York Times made a request. Therefore, I do not have the
negative, and I do not know the source of the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that true with regard to all of the pictures that you produced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. My office called Life magazine, and asked someone at Life magazine
on the photo desk, the editorial department, if a picture could be made
available and they stated that they would not make a glossy available&mdash;it was
their policy in reference to all pictures in their possession.</p>

<p>Those are the only inquiries I made with reference to the source of the
pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now you may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. I would like to raise one other peripheral matter before
going into the evidence, if I might. That is, I would like to call to the attention
of the Commission this article, and ask that it be marked as an exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That has been marked Commission Exhibit 342.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 342, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>This is an article appearing in the New York Journal American Sunday, February
23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This consists of two separate pages, does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It does&mdash;the first page being a masthead and front page, headline
from the Journal American, dated Sunday, February 23, 1964, and the second
page containing a portion of the front page of the Journal American on that
date, and a portion of page 15, the continued story of the Journal American on
the same date.</p>

<p>This is an article written by Bob Considine, who enjoys a reputation for
being an excellent reporter. Mr. Considine states in his article that an eyewitness
to the shooting of Officer Tippit by the name of Warren Reynolds was
himself recently shot through the head by a man with a rifle.</p>

<p>Now, I don't believe that it is alleged that Reynolds actually saw the person
pull the trigger which sent the bullets at Officer Tippit. As I understand it,
Mr. Reynolds has stated that he, Reynolds, heard the shot, the shooting, left
his office and saw a man running away, placing new shells into a pistol as he
ran away. And Mr. Considine indicates that Reynolds thereafter identified
Oswald as the person who was running from the scene.</p>

<p>This article indicated that during January, Mr. Reynolds was himself shot
through the head with a rifle, and that he is in the hospital&mdash;I believe he was
in the hospital at that time. I don't know what the state of his health is at
the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. Considine indicates that a person was picked up in the Dallas area and
charged with the shooting, but that someone who Mr. Considine refers to as
"his girl"&mdash;I assume he is making reference to the gentleman who was charged
with the attack upon Reynolds&mdash;testified in such a fashion, and took a lie detector
test, so that the person charged with the crime was released.</p>

<p>This person, Betty Mooney MacDonald, who helped to free her friend, according
to Mr. Considine, herself had worked as a stripper in the Carousel Club in
Dallas, owned by Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Two weeks before this article was written, Miss MacDonald was herself
arrested for a fight with her roommate, and the week before the article was
written, Mr. Considine states she hanged herself in her cell.</p>

<p>I would request the Commission to investigate into these series of most unusual
coincidences, to see if they have any bearing upon the basic matter pending
before the Commission.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be introduced as are all of these pictures, admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 334 to 342, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. In the course of my investigation, I have come across some material
which would be relevant only if I was first able to examine the rifle, quite
frankly. I wonder if that might be able to be accomplished sometime during
the day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. During the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Today, if possible.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, I think not, because we don't have it. But we will make
it available to you, though, at the very first opportunity, Mr. Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Fine. Then I will reserve my comment in reference to the rifle
for that occasion.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Thank you. I would like to, on behalf of Lee Harvey Oswald,
make this information available to the Commission.</p>

<p>It, of course, has been alleged by the chief of police of Dallas, and by the
district attorney of Dallas that Oswald was present on the sixth floor of the
Texas Book Depository Building during the very early afternoon of November
22, 1963, and that from that area he fired an Italian carbine, 6.5 millimeters,
three times, twice striking the President of the United States, wounding him
fatally, and injuring the Governor of Texas by striking him with a bullet, on
one occasion.</p>

<p>The physician who signed the death certificate of the President pronouncing
him dead was Dr. Kemp Clark, whose name appeared on the official homicide
report filed by the Dallas Police Department, and attested to by two police
officers.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November, the New York Times reported, "Dr. Kemp Clark,
who pronounced Mr. Kennedy dead, said one bullet struck him at about the
necktie knot, 'It ranged downward in his chest and did not exit' the surgeon
said."</p>

<p>On the same day the New York Herald Tribune stated, "On the basis of
accumulated data, investigators have concluded that the first shot fired as the
Presidential car was approaching, struck the President in the neck, just above
the knot of his necktie, then ranged downward into his body."</p>

<p>According to Richard Dudman&mdash;Mr. Dudman is the Washington correspondent,
as I am sure you all know better than I, for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch&mdash;according
to him, the surgeons who attended the President while he was at the
Parkland Memorial Hospital, described the wound&mdash;were in agreement in
describing the wound in the throat as an entrance wound. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch
on December 1 carried a rather long and involved story by Mr. Dudman,
recounting his conversations with the physicians who were treating the President
on the 22d at the Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. Perry explained that he began to open an air passage in the President's
throat in an effort to restore his breathing, and he explained that the incision
had been made through the bullet wound in the President's throat&mdash;since that
was in the correct place for the operation, in any event. Dr. Perry, according
to Mr. Dudman, described to him the bullet hole as an entrance wound.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert N. McClelland, who was one of the three physicians who participated
in that operation, later stated to Mr. Dudman, "It certainly did look
like an entrance wound."</p>

<p>He went on to say that he saw bullet wounds every day in Dallas, sometimes
several times a day, and that this did appear to be an entrance wound.</p>

<p>One doctor made reference to the frothing of blood in the neck wound. The
doctor said, "He is bubbling air." Two of the doctors, Drs. Peters and Baxter,
inserted a tube into the right upper part of the President's chest, just below
the shoulder, to reexpand the lungs, and to keep them from collapsing.</p>

<p>Dr. Jones and Dr. Perry inserted a similar tube on the left portion of the
President's chest.</p>

<p>The activity was necessitated because the bubbling air was the first clue that
they had that the President's lung had been punctured.</p>

<p>The prosecuting authorities, confronted with what seemed then to be evidence
that the President had been shot from the front, in the <span class="locked">throat&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Are you reading now, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, I am just making reference to this. That is not a quote.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It is not a quote. You are just paraphrasing what was in
this article of Mr. Dudman's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, I am leaving Mr. Dudman now, and going on to statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
made by the prosecuting authorities. I will submit quotations&mdash;I will try to
remember to place quotation marks when I have a quotation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The authorities who were confronted with what seemed to be
irrefutable evidence that the President had been shot in the front of the throat,
concluded that the Presidential limousine was approaching the Book Depository
Building when the first shot was fired, because it seems at the very outset a
theory was developed by the prosecuting authorities that Oswald was on the
sixth floor of the Book Depository Building, that he was the assassin, and that
he acted alone.</p>

<p>I think that the record and an examination of the activities of the Dallas
police, and the Dallas district attorney's office, will show that the only area
where they have been consistent from the outset was once this theory was
enunciated, they stayed with the theory, and they were devoted to the theory,
regardless of the discovery of new evidence and new facts.</p>

<p>For example, the New York Times stated on November 26, 1963, "The known
facts about the bullets, and the position of the assassin, suggested that he started
shooting as the President's car was coming toward him, swung his rifle in an
arc of almost 180°, and fired at least twice more." At that time, the prosecution
case had already been developed in terms of the theory that Oswald was the
assassin and that Oswald acted alone.</p>

<p>There were newspaper pictures published in many portions of the country
showing the Textbook Depository Building on Houston Street where the Presidential
limousine approached the Book Depository Building, and Elm Street,
where after the limousine made a sharp left turn it continued until it reached
the underpass directly ahead.</p>

<p>And in these newspapers, there were superimposed dotted lines showing the
trajectory of the three bullets, showing that the first bullet was fired while the
Presidential car was still on Houston Street, still approaching the Book Depository
Building.</p>

<p>However, it soon became essential for the prosecution to abandon that theory,
because the eyewitnesses present, including Governor Connally, and Mrs. Connally,
stated that the limousine had already made a left turn, had passed the
Book Depository Building at the time that the first shot was fired.</p>

<p>In essence, then, the prosecution remained with the theory that Oswald,
while acting alone, shot the President from the front from the back.</p>

<p><span class="locked">However,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I don't understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I don't understand that either, but this was the theory of the
prosecution&mdash;that the President had&mdash;it had been conceded at that time that
the President had been shot in the front of the throat. However, the evidence
then developed indicated that the Presidential limousine had already passed
the Book Depository Building, and the President was not facing the Book Depository
Building when the first shot was fired. At that time, Life magazine
explains it all in a full page article entitled, "An End to Nagging Rumors, the
6 Crucial Seconds."</p>

<p>And Life conceded that the limousine was some 50 yards past Oswald when
the first shot was fired, and that the shot entered the President's throat from
the front, but explained that the President had turned completely around and
was facing the Book Depository Building when the shot was fired.</p>

<p>But that theory, however, could <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have the date of that article?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That was December 6, Life magazine. The full page article was
entitled "End to Nagging Rumors, the Six Critical Seconds."</p>

<p>The <span class="locked">problem&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask a question there&mdash;just to clarify? Did you say
that in this article that Life said that the late President had turned around and
was facing the Book Depository Building when the shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, Senator. The trouble with that theory, however, which was
enunciated by Life, and from where they secured it I do not know, but they
certainly were in Dallas very much in evidence on the scene&mdash;was that the week
prior to then Life magazine itself printed the stills of the motion pictures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
in those stills, with Life's own captions, it was quite plain that the President
was looking almost completely forward, just slightly to the right, but almost
forward, and certainly not turned around when the first shot was fired. And
so the stills printed in Life's own publication a week before they enunciated this
theory proved that the Life theory was false.</p>

<p>In addition to this, persons present on the scene, such witnesses as Mrs. Connally
and the Governor of Texas, indicated that the President was looking almost
straight ahead. And I believe that Mrs. Connally stated that she had just made a
statement to the President, tragically enough, something about, "You cannot
say the people of Dallas have not given you a warm welcome today," and he
was about to respond when the first bullet struck him.</p>

<p>In order for the prosecution to remain with the theory in the light of the
new evidence that Oswald was the assassin and he acted alone, something would
have to give, and it became plain that the third try would have to result in a new
examination of the medical testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. Dudman stated that the doctors at Parkland Hospital, who had, of course,
this vital evidence to offer, were never questioned about the vital evidence by
the FBI or by the Secret Service, and that it was not until after an autopsy had
been performed at Bethesda, that two Secret Service agents, armed with that
report, journeyed down to the Parkland Hospital and talked to the doctors, for
the purpose of explaining to them that the new medical testimony and evidence
indicated they were all in error at the outset. And, eventually, that was the
position agreed to by the physicians, that they all had been in error when they
stated that it was an entrance wound in the throat.</p>

<p>Physicians seem to agree that a short period of time after death, as a
result of the deterioration of tissue, it is much more difficult to examine
wounds to determine if they are entrance wounds or exit wounds.</p>

<p>In addition to this, according to Mr. Dudman in the Post Dispatch there
had been an operation performed on what the doctors thought then was an
entrance wound; therefore, it would seem altering the wound in the throat
so that it would probably be more difficult to determine if it were an entrance
or an exit wound, after the operation had been completed.</p>

<p>However, I do not know, of course, what is in the autopsy report&mdash;very
likely you have seen that report&mdash;but portions of it, whether accurately or
inaccurately, have been leaked to the public through the press. And the
portion which has been leaked to the press, to the public through the press,
in reference to the wound in the President's throat, indicated that the bullet
struck the back of the President's head, and either a fragment of the bullet
or a fragment of bone from the President's head exited at the throat.</p>

<p>If this were so, while it could explain perhaps the wound in the throat,
it would be difficult to understand why this was not apparent to the doctors
in the Parkland Hospital, particularly in view of the fact that it would
indicate that the path of the bullet ran from the top of the head down to
the throat, not from the throat down to the back of the chest, a very
different path entirely.</p>

<p>And since Dr. Perry indicated that he inserted a tube into the President's
throat following the bullet wound, it would be difficult to understand how
he was not aware of the path of the bullet, when it was absolutely in the
opposite direction from the one he thought it was in when he inserted the
tube.</p>

<p>Most remarkable of all, though, is that if the bullet entered the top of the
head, and a portion of it or a portion of bone exited from the throat, the
collapse of the lungs and the frothing of air at the throat are both indications
of a punctured lung&mdash;it would be difficult to explain by that particular
bullet's path.</p>

<p>I think that an openminded investigating and prosecuting agency would
have found, at the outset, in view of the medical evidence available at the outset,
that the President was shot from the front while facing slightly to the right,
and after passing the book depository building&mdash;an openminded investigating
body in Dallas, the district attorney's office or the police, or others who
were associated in that investigation, might have considered abandoning
their theory that Oswald was the assassin and that he acted alone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
might have been led by the factual data to investigate in other areas as
well&mdash;clearly something that they did not do.</p>

<p>I have been informed by reporters, for example, that&mdash;reporters from
foreign countries covering the trial, that some of them were very concerned
about the fact that they would now not be able to leave Dallas, that clearly
the airports would be closed, there would be roadblocks placed on many of
the streets, the trains would be stopped or searched, in order that the
assassin or those who assisted him, or those who assisted the assassins,
might be prevented from readily leaving the entire area.</p>

<p>I am informed by the reporters in the area that there were no such roadblocks,
that planes continued to leave, trains continued to leave, and that
the prosecution continued with its theory that Oswald was the assassin,
that he acted alone, and they had secured his arrest, and there was nothing
more to be done other than to prove as conclusively as possible, utilizing the
press as we know, and the television, and the radio media for that purpose.</p>

<p>And while I am on this question, I wonder if I might ask the Commission
to give consideration to&mdash;although I don't believe that it is present in
any of the six panels which have been established by the Commission&mdash;but
to give consideration nevertheless to the 48 hours in which Oswald was in
custody, in reference to what happened to his rights as an American citizen,
charged with a crime in this country.</p>

<p>The statement by the National Board of the American Civil Liberties
Union, that had Oswald lived he could not have secured a fair trial anywhere
in this country.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be sure, Mr. Lane, that that will be given most
serious consideration by the Commission, and the Commission has already
appointed as an act in that direction the President of the American Bar
Association, with such help as he may wish to have, to make an investigation
of that very thing. I assure you it will be done by the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Getting back to the evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, the spectator
closest to President Kennedy, a Mrs. Hill, who was a substitute teacher in
the Dallas public school system, stated to me that she was in her view the
closest spectator to the President, and was standing alongside a Mary
Moorman, who resides in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have the date of this interview, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It was within the last week. She stated to me that she was
the closest spectator to the President, she and her friend, when the President
was struck by a bullet. She said that she heard some four to six shots fired.</p>

<p>Now, she was standing on the grass across the&mdash;across Elm Street, across
from the Texas Book Depository Building. She said that in her&mdash;it is her
feeling that all of the shots, the four to six shots, came from the grassy
knoll near the triple overpass which was at that time directly in front and
slightly to the right of the Presidential limousine, and that in her view
none of the shots were fired from the Book Depository Building which was
directly across the street from her, and which was to the rear of the
Presidential limousine.</p>

<p>She said further that after the last shot was fired, she saw a man run from
behind the general area of a concrete facade on that grassy knoll, and that he
ran on to the triple overpass.</p>

<p>She told me that standing alongside of her was Mary Moorman, who took a
picture of the President just a brief moment before the first shot was fired, and
that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation took the film from Miss
Moorman, and gave her a receipt, which she still has in her possession, but that
she has not been able to see the picture, and that it is possible that the picture
included the entire Book Depository Building, taken just precisely a second or
less before the shots were fired.</p>

<p>Tom Wicker, who is a member of the New York Times White House staff, who
was the only New York Times reporter in Dallas when the President was shot,
stated in an article which appeared in the Saturday Review, on January 11,
1964, "As we came out of the overpass, I saw a motorcycle policeman drive over
the curb, cross an open area, a few feet up a railroad bank, dismount, and start
scrambling up the bank." Ronnie Dugger, who is the editor of the Texas Observer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
a statewide publication in Texas, stated in his publication on November
29, 1963, and later stated to me in two different interviews material of the
same nature.</p>

<p>I am now quoting from the publication:</p>

<p>"On the other side of the overpass a motorcycle policeman was roughriding
across some grass to the trestle for the railroad tracks, across the overpass. He
brought his cycle to a halt and leapt from it and was running up the base of
the trestle when I lost sight of him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you give us the date of the paper that came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. That was the Texas Observer, November 29, 1963. That
statement has been confirmed by Mr. Dugger to me in two interviews in Dallas.</p>

<p>James Vachule, who is a reporter for the Fort Worth Star Telegram, said,
"I heard the shots, several, at the triple overpass."</p>

<p>And Jerry Flemmons, reporting also for the Fort Worth Star Telegram, on
November 22, 1963, stated, "Kennedy was gunned down by an assassin, apparently
standing on the overpass above the freeway."</p>

<p>Now, I spoke to a Mary Woodward, who is an employee of the Dallas Morning
News, and she stated that she was present with three coworkers, all employees
of the Dallas Morning News, and they were standing near the&mdash;the base of the
grassy knoll, perhaps 50 feet or so from the overpass, with the overpass to their
right, and the book depository building to their left. And on November 23,
1963, the Dallas Morning News ran a story by Miss Woodward, and I have since
that time spoken with Miss Woodward by telephone, and she has confirmed portions&mdash;the
entire portion which I will quote from now&mdash;in her conversation
with me.</p>

<p>That is, that as she and her three coworkers waited for the President to pass,
on the grassy slope just east of the triple overpass, she explained that the President
approached and acknowledged their cheers and the cheers of others, "he
faced forward again, and suddenly there was an ear-shattering noise coming from
behind us and a little to the right."</p>

<p>Here we have a statement, then, by an employee of the Dallas Morning News,
evidently speaking&mdash;she indicated to me that she was speaking on behalf of all
four employees, all of whom stated that the shots came from the direction of
the overpass, which was to their right, and not at all from the Book Depository
Building, which was to their left.</p>

<p>Miss Woodward continued, "Instead of speeding up the car, the car came to a
halt. Things are a little bit hazy from this point, but I don't believe anyone
was hit with the first bullet. The President and Mrs. Kennedy turned and
looked around as if they, too, didn't believe the noise was really coming from a
gun. Then after a moment's pause there was another shot, and I saw the
President slumping in the car."</p>

<p>This would seem to be consistent with the statement by Miss Hill that more
than three shots were fired.</p>

<p>In addition to these statements, James A. Chaney, who is a Dallas motorcycle
policeman, was quoted in the Houston Chronicle on November 24, 1963, as stating
that the first shot missed entirely. He said he was 6 feet to the right and front
of the President's car, moving about 15 miles an hour, and when the first shot
was fired. "I thought it was a backfire", he said.</p>

<p>Now, Miss Hill told me that when she was questioned&mdash;put that word unfortunately
in quotation marks&mdash;by the U.S. Secret Service agents, that they indicated
to her what her testimony should be, and that is that she only heard
three shots. And she insisted that she heard from four to six shots. And she
said that at least one agent of the Secret Service said to her, "There were three
wounds and there were three shells, so we are only saying three shots." And
they raised with her the possibility that instead of hearing more than three shots,
that she might have heard firecrackers exploding, or that she might have heard
echoes.</p>

<p>Despite this type of questioning by the Secret Service, Miss Hill continued to
maintain, the last I spoke with her, about a week ago, that she heard from four
to six shots.</p>

<p>Now, to the best of my knowledge, from my investigation, which has been very
severely limited by lack of personnel and almost total lack of funds, and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
is clearly not the kind of investigation which is required here&mdash;but from
this limited investigation, it seems that only two persons immediately charged
into the Texas Book Depository Building after the shots were fired. They were
an officer of the Dallas Police Force, Seymour Weitzman, who submitted an affidavit
to the Dallas police office, in which he stated that he discovered the rifle
on the sixth floor of the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>There was one other gentleman who ran into the building, and that was Roy S.
Truly, who was and is, I believe, the director of the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Truly stated that he believed that the shots came from the direction
of the overpass and from the grassy knoll. And although he was standing
directly in front of the Book Depository Building, he did not believe that the
shots came from that building.</p>

<p>Standing with him at the time of the assassination was O.&nbsp;V. Campbell, who
was the vice president of the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>In the Dallas Morning News on November 23, 1963, it was stated that "Campbell
says he ran toward a grassy knoll to the west of the building where he
thought the sniper had hidden."</p>

<p>So we have two persons that we know of standing in front of the Book Depository
Building, and they both thought that the shots came from the grassy
knoll near the overpass.</p>

<p>The police officer, Seymour Weitzman, submitted an affidavit to the Dallas
district attorney's office, he and Mr. Truly, as I indicated a moment ago were
the only two who charged into the Book Depository Building when the shots
were fired.</p>

<p>Weitzman indicated in his affidavit&mdash;I assume you have the original of that
affidavit&mdash;that he ran "in a northwest direction, scaled the fence toward where
we thought the shots came from."</p>

<p>He indicated "then someone said they thought the shots came from the old
Texas Building. I immediately ran to the Texas Building and started looking
inside."</p>

<p>So even the two people who ran into the building indicated that they did not
believe the shots came from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. Weitzman went into the building because someone whose name he did not
give in his affidavit told him to go into the building, and then Truly explained
that although he thought the shots came from the general direction of the grassy
knoll or the overpass in front of the President's limousine, he saw this officer
run into the building, of which he is a director, and he felt that since he knew
the building and the officer did not, he should go in the building to assist the
officer.</p>

<p>From published accounts, and from my investigation, I can only find one person
who thought that the shots came from the building, and that was the Chief
of Police in Dallas, Jesse Curry, who said as soon as the shots were fired, he
knew they came from the building. From the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Now, of course, there were many persons present there whom I have not quoted,
to whom I have no access.</p>

<p>Now, I spoke on several occasions with the reporter for the Fort Worth Star
Telegram, whose name is Thayer Waldo. Mr. Waldo was standing with a police
captain near the Dallas Trade Mart Building, which was the building, public
building, where the President was going to have spoken that day. Mr. Waldo
was awaiting his arrival, the President's arrival there, when a sergeant who was
seated in a police cruiser called the captain over hurriedly to the police car.
Mr. Waldo accompanied the captain to the police car. And Mr. Waldo stated to
me that he heard the first bulletin which came over the Dallas police radio, and it
was "Bulletin. The President has been shot. It is feared that others in his
party have been wounded. The shots came from a triple overpass in front of
the Presidential automobile."</p>

<p>So even the police, despite the Chief of Police's later assertion that he knew
that the shots came from the Book Depository Building, behind the Presidential
limousine, the first police radio broadcast indicated that it was the police position
at that time that the shots came from the front, not from the rear.</p>

<p>Now, Patrolman Chaney, who I made reference to a little earlier, the motorcycle
patrolman, stated that the Presidential car stopped momentarily after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
first shot. That statement was consistent with Miss Woodward's statement in
the Dallas Morning News, that the automobile came to almost a complete halt
after the first shot, and the statement of many other witnesses as well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was that statement made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That statement appeared in the newspaper I made reference to
before, the Houston Chronicle, on November 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you made an independent inquiry at any time, would you
tell us, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, I certainly shall do that.</p>

<p>Now, I think one has to conjecture as to why the Secret Service agent who
was undoubtedly trained for this assignment, and particularly the agent who
was driving the Presidential limousine in Dallas, where we were told that the
greatest efforts ever to protect an American President were going to be made
that day, because of the previous difficulties in Dallas, the attack upon our Ambassador
to the United Nations and the attack upon the then Senator Johnson,
when he spoke in Dallas in 1960&mdash;one would assume that the most qualified Secret
Service driver that could be secured would be driving that automobile. It is
difficult to understand why the automobile almost came to a complete stop after
the first shot was fired, if the shots were coming from the rear. The natural
inclination, it would seem, would be to step on the gas and accelerate as quickly
as possible. However, if the driver were under the impression that the shots
were from the front, one could understand his hesitation in not wanting to drive
closer to the sniper or snipers.</p>

<p>In addition, however, Roy Kellerman, who was in the front right-hand seat
of the automobile, who I am told was in charge of the Secret Service operation
that day, the director of the Secret Service not being present in Dallas on
that occasion&mdash;according to the pictures printed in Life magazine, Mr. Kellerman
looked forward until the first shot was fired. Then he turned back, and
looked at the President. He immediately looked forward again, and was looking
in the direction of the overpass while the second shot was fired, and while the
third shot was fired.</p>

<p>One would certainly expect that Mr. Kellerman was and is a trained observer,
who would not panic in such a circumstance, for which he has received his
training.</p>

<p>The pictures I make reference to are those in Life magazine which I referred
to a little earlier in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask a question there, Mr. Chief Justice?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, go right ahead, Senator.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. This last statement you made, about the Secret Service
agent who turned, so that he was faced to the rear, toward the President,
and then turned forward&mdash;I didn't quite understand what you deduced from
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I assumed that he was looking toward the sound of the shots.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You mean when he turned to the rear, or turned ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, when the President was shot, and was struck he then turned
around, which I would imagine would be an ordinary response when somebody
in an automobile with whom you are riding has been shot.</p>

<p>But immediately after that, before the second shot was fired, he turned completely
to the front, and was looking at the overpass during the remainder
of the time that the shots were fired. It would seem to indicate to me that it
is possible that Mr. Kellerman felt that the shots were coming from the general
direction in which he was looking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you base your statement on that the car stopped, the
President's limousine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The statement made by various witnesses, including Mr. Chaney,
a motorcycle policeman, Miss Woodward, who was one of the closest witnesses
to the President at the time that he was shot, and others. I think that is the&mdash;I
haven't documented that beyond that, because that seemed to be so generally
conceded by almost everyone, that the automobile came to&mdash;almost came to a
complete halt after the first shot&mdash;did not quite stop, but almost did. And,
of course, you have the films, I assume, of the assassination and know more
about that than I do, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Now, in reference to the rifle, there is on file&mdash;I assume that you have it
or copies of it&mdash;in the Dallas district attorney's office or the police office in
Dallas, an affidavit sworn to by Officer Weitzman, in which he indicates that
he discovered the rifle on the sixth floor of the Book Depository Building at, I believe,
1:22 p.m., on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Now, in this affidavit, Officer Weitzman swore that the murder weapon&mdash;that
the weapon which he found on the sixth floor was a 7.65 Mauser, which
he then went on to describe in some detail, with reference to the color of the
strap, et cetera.</p>

<p>Now, the prosecuting attorney, of course, took exactly the same position, and
for hours insisted that the rifle discovered on the sixth floor was a German
Mauser, adding the nationality. A German Mauser is nothing at all like an
Italian carbine. I think almost any rifle expert will indicate that that is so.</p>

<p>I have been informed that almost every Mauser&mdash;and I am not able to document
this, unfortunately, but I am sure that you have easy access to rifle experts&mdash;that
almost every German Mauser has stamped upon it the caliber, as does
almost every Italian carbine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know the difference between the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Do I know the difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I know the difference between an Army M-l and an American
carbine&mdash;those are the only two weapons I fired&mdash;during the war. No, I don't
know anything about rifles, other than those two rifles, which I used at one
time.</p>

<p>I think it is most interesting to note that when Oswald was arrested we were
informed immediately that he had an alias&mdash;his last name was Lee in that
alias&mdash;as well as a great deal of material about his political background and
activities on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and his defection
to the Soviet Union, et cetera. But the alias was raised immediately.</p>

<p>The following day, on the 23d, when it was announced by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, that Oswald had purchased an Italian carbine, 6.5
millimeters, under the assumed name, A. Hidell, then for the first time the
district attorney of Dallas indicated that the rifle in his possession, the alleged
murder weapon, had changed both nationality and size, and had become from
a German 7.65 Mauser, an Italian 6.5 carbine. And, further he indicated
then for the first time that they knew of another alias maintained by Lee
Oswald. In addition to the name Lee, which they discovered, they said, by
going to the home where he lived&mdash;the house where he had lived in Dallas,
where he rented a room, a rooming house, they discovered there he had secured
the room under the name Lee. Mr. Wade stated that on Oswald's person, in
his pocketbook, was an identification card made out to A. Hidell, and I have
seen pictures of this reproduced in either Time magazine or Newsweek, or
one of the weekly news magazines&mdash;I believe it was one or the other&mdash;with
a picture of Oswald appearing on this card, plainly indicating that Oswald had
the alias A. Hidell, to Mr. Wade.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting that the name Lee as an alias was released immediately,
although some investigation was required to secure that alias. But the
name A. Hidell, was not released as an alias, although that was present and
obvious by mere search of Oswald's person when he was arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you give us the time of the release of the information about
the alias, A. Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That was on November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And how about Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. November 22. The first release of the name A. Hidell came from
the district attorney's office after the FBI had indicated that Oswald had purchased
an Italian carbine under that name.</p>

<p>If I were permitted to cross-examine Mr. Wade, which evidently you have
decided that I shall not be permitted to do, and Officer Weitzman, I would seek
to find out how about the most important single element in probably this case
or any other murder case, physical evidence, the murder weapon, in a case which
I am sure is Mr. Wade's most important case&mdash;how he could be so completely
in error about this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Mr. Wade is a very distinguished prosecuting attorney, has been one for
some 13 or 14 years, and I believe was an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
prior to that time.</p>

<p>I would like to know how he could have been so wrong about something so
vital.</p>

<p>Now, assuming that the rifle found on the sixth floor was an Italian rifle,
Italian carbine, one must wonder how it was possible for any number of things
to happen for it to be fired there three times and strike the President in front
of the throat, although he was past that building, and for the noise, according
to the witnesses of the shooting, to have come from a different place entirely.</p>

<p>But in addition to that, one must wonder if that rifle is capable of the performance
which the prosecuting authorities allege that it gave on that day.
An Olympic rifle champion, Hubert Hammerer, said that he doubts that it
could be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you give us his address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He is not in the United States. The story appeared in the New
York Times. I don't have the exact date.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What nationality is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you know when he was Olympic champion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No, I don't know that. I do know it probably was some time
after the Italian carbine was manufactured, since it is an extremely old weapon,
manufactured back in 1938, as I recall. There seems to be an agreement that
the period of time was between 5 and 6 seconds from the first shot to the last
shot.</p>

<p>There is a serious question in the minds, I think, of persons who have fired
that pistol&mdash;that rifle&mdash;first of all, as to its ability to be fired that quickly
accurately with a telescopic sight, and secondly, in reference to the ammunition
which is available. Various persons have tested various lots of ammunition.
Someone from the National Rifle Association told me that he tested more than
30 rounds, a little over 30 rounds of the Italian <span class="locked">6.5&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you refer to these people, will you tell us the names of
any of them that you can? It might be of help to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I should remember this gentleman, because I just spoke with him.
That is another name I am going to have to supply for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He is a member of the board of directors of the National Rifle
Association. He purchased for one of the television networks some 30 rounds, a
little over 30 rounds, and told me that 20 of them did not fire at all, and 6 of
them were guilty of hanged fire, which is a phrase I don't know anything about,
but he tells me that means it did not fire fully, and, therefore, could not be
accurate. Therefore, a very small percentage of the ammunition was of any
value.</p>

<p>Mr. Ed Wallace talked about making a similar test in the New York World
Telegram and Sun, in a feature article, and I think he said that he went
with an expert, and they got 20 rounds of this ammunition, and of those 17
did not fire&mdash;only 3 fired. It was very old ammunition.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who is Ed Wallace, and who is the individual that Ed
Wallace referred to? Do you have that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I believe Mr. Wallace indicated that he was present when the
test was made. But it was an article appearing in the New York World Telegram
and Sun within a week after the assassination&mdash;from the 23d to the 30th
of November. And I can secure and mail to you a copy of that article, if you
prefer.</p>

<p>While there may be some question as to whether or not a rifle expert could
secure such performance from a rifle, or whether or not one could secure
enough good ammunition to get such performance, I think there is general
agreement that only in the hands of a rifle expert could one attempt to come
close to that kind of shooting that it is alleged Oswald did on November 22.</p>

<p>The Times reported on November 23, "As Marines go, Lee Harvey Oswald was
not highly regarded as a rifleman." And you have in your files, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the scorecard indicating Oswald's marksmanship or lack of marksmanship while
in the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>In addition to that, you have the documents given to you by Marguerite Oswald,
Lee Oswald's mother, which contained a scorecard maintained by Oswald while
in the Marine Corps, showing his score in fast and slow shooting at various different
yardages, in reference to both an M-l, as I recall, and an American
carbine. Now, of course, it has been alleged on occasion that Mr. Oswald practiced
with his rifle, on occasion, on weekends, at rifle ranges.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, with whom Lee Oswald's wife lived for the 2 month period preceding
the assassination, and where Lee Oswald himself spent weekends for
that 2 months period preceding the assassination, told me that Oswald could
not have ever gone to a rifle range on a weekend, since she can account for his
whereabouts during that entire 2 month period just preceding the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you give us the day of that conversation with Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I have had about five conversations with her. The first one would
be, oh, I believe, New Year's Day. I think that is the first time&mdash;this year&mdash;I
believe that is the first time that she made the statement to me. She said she
could account for Oswald's whereabouts during that 2 month period on weekends,
from Friday late afternoon, when he left work in Dallas and arrived
there in Irving, until early Monday morning.</p>

<p>She said the exception is during that time&mdash;she didn't watch him every moment,
of course&mdash;there might be exceptions when she went shopping for half
an hour, and he was left home to take care of the children, her two children, his
children. But that unless he ran out quickly into the back yard with the rifle
and shot and then quickly put the rifle away while caring for three children, or
four children, that it would be impossible for him to practice with the rifle
on weekends.</p>

<p>Since it has been alleged that the rifle was in the garage during the entire
period of time, of course&mdash;that was in Irving, Tex., and he was in Dallas, Tex.&mdash;it
would have been impossible for him to practice during the week while he
was in Dallas, with that particular rifle.</p>

<p>Of course one must zero in a rifle in order to be even fairly accurate with it.
One must practice with the specific weapon which one is going to use, in order
to have any accuracy, in any event.</p>

<p>Now, I spoke with Dial M. Ryder, who is a gunsmith in Irving, Tex., at the
Irving Sport Shop, and he told me that he mounted a telescopic sight on a rifle
for a man named Oswald during October 1963.</p>

<p>Now, unfortunately, he does not recall&mdash;that is around the deer season, he
informed me, and a lot of people are getting rifles fixed or repaired or sights
mounted on them during that time in the Dallas-Irving area. And he does not
recall, therefore, what this gentleman named Oswald looks like.</p>

<p>But he does know that a rifle was brought to him by someone whose name
now appears in this record as Oswald, and that he drilled three holes in the
rifle for a mount, telescopic mount. He said he had only seen three rifles
which required three holes for telescopic mount&mdash;a 303 British Enfield, a 303
American Springfield army surplus rifle, or an Eddystone, which is also an
American rifle. He said, therefore, he did not attach a telescopic sight to the
Italian carbine, because he would have only drilled two holes.</p>

<p>His employer, I think his name is Greener, he told me, checked with all the
Oswalds they could find in the Irving area after this matter came to their attention,
and could not find anyone in that area&mdash;and they called some people
in Dallas also named Oswald&mdash;could not find anyone named Oswald who brought
the rifle in to him.</p>

<p>I talked to Milton Klein, who is the owner of Klein's sporting goods store
in Chicago&mdash;Klein's Sporting Goods is the name of the establishment, in
Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I spoke with him within the last 2 or 3 days. And he told me that&mdash;he
runs the mail-order house which sent the carbine, Italian carbine, to Dallas,
not to Oswald, but to A. Hidell, and that he sent that out with the holes already
bored in the Italian carbine, and equipped with a telescopic sight which was
already attached to the rifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Aguto Marcelli, who is a correspondent for an Italian publication which appears
physically very much to be like Life magazine, called Leuropeo, stated
to me that he had spoken with Mr. Klein, and Mr. Klein told him that the
FBI&mdash;"The FBI warned me to keep my trap shut."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He told me this about 2 weeks ago. When I spoke with Mr. Klein,
about 3 days ago, 2 or 3 days ago, he indicated that he did not want to discuss
any aspect of this matter with me. And I asked him if that was because he was
told not to talk with anyone about this case, and he said yes.</p>

<p>And I said, "Who told you that?"</p>

<p>He said, "The FBI agents told me, ordered me not to discuss this case."</p>

<p>I pointed out to him that if he did not wish to discuss the case with me, I
would not force him to. There was no way that he would be compelled to
answer any of the questions that I asked him. But, however, in our democratic
society, the FBI cannot order anyone not to discuss a case, and that such an order
to him was not a valid order, if he wanted to discuss the case with me&mdash;he could.</p>

<p>So he did. And he told me what I informed you&mdash;that the FBI told him not
to discuss the case, and that he mailed this rifle with the holes already bored
and with the telescopic sight already mounted to someone named A. Hidell.</p>

<p>He also said that "No ammunition was purchased from me by Hidell at that
time or since."</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he name any person with the FBI who told him not to
discuss the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Can you identify&mdash;did he identify him in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He did not identify him. Earlier, perhaps before you arrived,
Senator, I made reference to a statement made by Mrs. Hill, who was told by
the Secret Service&mdash;I think perhaps you were here&mdash;that only three shots were
fired. And I asked her specifically if she could identify that Secret Service
agent, and she told me that she could not, there was such tremendous confusion
at that time, there were so many agents of the FBI and Secret Service that
she spoke to, that she did not think she could. But possibly if she saw him,
she might be able to recognize him.</p>

<p>I didn't go any further into that question, however, with Mr. Klein. He
seemed very reluctant to discuss that entire area&mdash;to discuss anything, but
particularly that area.</p>

<p>I read in the Dallas Times Herald, on November 25, 1963, the statement made
by Mr. Wade, when asked what they had tying Oswald to the "crime of the
century" and his response was, according to the Dallas Times Herald, "If I
had to single out any one thing, it would be the fingerprints on the rifle, and
the book cartons which he used to prop the weapon on."</p>

<p>On the same day the World Telegram and Sun reported "Federal authorities
have concluded that no readable print was found on the murder weapon when it
was flown to Washington for laboratory studies."</p>

<p>There were certain leaks that a fingerprint or a palm print was discovered
on the bolt of the rifle. If that is so, it would be remarkable if it were a print
belonging to anyone other than Captain Fritz of the Homicide Squad in Dallas,
because according to the affidavit signed by Officer Weitzman, who discovered
the weapon, and I am quoting now from the affidavit on file&mdash;at that time on
file with the district attorney's office, "The time the rifle was found was 1:22
p.m. Captain Fritz took charge of the rifle, and ejected one live round from the
Chamber. I then went back to the office after this."</p>

<p>Now, you know if you have worked with that rifle that the&mdash;on most Italian
carbines that bolt is not worked too easily. One really has to grab a hold of it
and pull back. It would be unusual if a fingerprint belonging to someone other
than the person who did that survived.</p>

<p>The first statement made by Mr. Wade in reference to the taxi driver who he
alleged&mdash;he, Wade, alleged took Oswald generally from this scene, indicated that
the driver's name was Daryl Click.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Now, that statement was not made in the first hours of the arrest. That statement
was not made until after Chief Curry had announced to the press in
Dallas, on that day, November 24th that the case was closed, there would be
no further investigation&mdash;Oswald was the assassin, he had acted alone, he was
then dead. And as a result of the change in policy, to reopen the case and
have Mr. Wade assume a position in front of the radio and television microphones
and cameras of the Nation, on that evening November 24, Mr. Wade
then presented what he said was the evidence "for you piece by piece." And
part of the evidence which he had secured was the proof that a taxi driver
named Daryl Click drove Oswald roughly from the scene to his home, to
Oswald's home.</p>

<p>When I was in Dallas&mdash;I suppose this was on January 2d, my first trip
there in reference to this matter&mdash;I spoke with a Mr. Roseboro of the Teamsters
Union&mdash;they have organized the taxi drivers in Dallas&mdash;and asked him if he
knew&mdash;if he could give me any information about a Daryl Click. He said he
did not have the name in his files, but Texas being a right-to-work law State,
it is possible, he said, that Mr. Click was a driver but not a member of that
union. He referred me to the personnel department of the City Transportation
Co., which he told me was the one company monopoly running all the taxis in
Dallas.</p>

<p>I spoke with the City Transportation Co. personnel office, Mr. Pott, as I recalled,
who checked the records, and indicated to me that there was no Daryl
Click who drove a taxi in Dallas.</p>

<p>Some time after Mr. Wade stated that Daryl Click was the taxi driver, he
then stated that a person by the name of William Whaley was the taxi driver
who took Oswald from the scene after he left the bus to his home.</p>

<p>It is therefore alleged by the prosecution that Oswald, after firing upon the
Presidential limousine, walked the entire floor from the front of the Book
Depository Building to the rear of the warehouse, almost to the extreme rear,
where he hid the rifle, where it was found, and then took the stairs at the rear
of the Book Depository Building and walked down four flights, until he arrived at
the second floor, and then he walked to the Coca-Cola machine, which was at
the front of the building, meaning he crossed the entire warehouse floor again,
and he purchased a Coca-Cola, and was sipping it when a police officer arrived
with a gun drawn, questioned him briefly. Mr. Truly explained to the officer that
Oswald worked there. And eventually Oswald left the building, boarded a bus,
then walked, after leaving the bus&mdash;walked two blocks and entered Mr. Whaley's
taxi, at exactly 12:30, according to Mr. Whaley. The shots that killed the
President were fired at 12:31.</p>

<p>Now, there is on file in the district attorney's office&mdash;I assume you have
the original or copies of it&mdash;a report of a paraffin test taken of Oswald, of
both his hands and his face. The test proved, according to Mr. Curry, and
the statement that he made on Saturday, November 23, to the press that
Oswald had fired the murder weapon. However, a reading of the test indicates
that one could come to a very different conclusion.</p>

<p>The test in reference to the face proved negative, indicating that Oswald had
not fired a rifle on November 22, 1963&mdash;although the test on the hands showed
positive&mdash;indicating, according to the person who did the analysis, the kinds
of patterns consistent with one having fired a revolver. That was the statement
on the test taken and conducted by a Louis L. Anderson, on November 23,
1963, by the Dallas City County Crime Investigation Laboratory.</p>

<p>Now, it has, of course, been alleged that after Oswald shot the President
and took a bus and a taxi, and went home and got a jacket, he then shot and
killed Officer Tippit. The affidavit in the district attorney's office indicates that
a person saw a stopped police car, walked up to the police car, leaned on it
with his arms on the window, or what would be a windowsill or window ledge of
the automobile, and then stepped back a step or two, the officer came out, and
this person shot Officer Tippit to death.</p>

<p>The affidavit is peculiarly sparse in reference to the description of the assailant,
the man who killed Tippit, by an eyewitness who said she was just
50 feet away.</p>

<p>Her description of this person is found in two different portions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
affidavit&mdash;he was young, white, male, and that is the entire description present
in the affidavit at that time.</p>

<p>I spoke with the deponent, the eyewitness, Helen Louise Markham, and
Mrs. Markham told me&mdash;Miss or Mrs., I didn't ask her if she was married&mdash;told
me that she was a hundred feet away from the police car, not the 50
feet which appears in the affidavit. She gave to me a more detailed description of
the man who she said shot Officer Tippit. She said he was short, a little
on the heavy side, and his hair was somewhat bushy. I think it is fair to
state that an accurate description of Oswald would be average height, quite
slender, with thin and receding hair.</p>

<p>Helen Markham said to me that she was taken to the police station on that
same day, that she was very upset, she of course had never seen anyone
killed in front of her eyes before, and that in the police station she identified
Oswald as the person who had shot Officer Tippit in the lineup, including
three other persons. She said no one pointed Oswald out to her&mdash;she was just
shown four people, and she picked Oswald.</p>

<p>She said&mdash;when I asked her how she could identify him&mdash;she indicated she
was able to identify him because of his clothing, a gray jacket and dark
trousers. And this was the basis for her identification&mdash;although Oswald physically
does not meet the description which she indicated.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you have this conversation with the deponent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Within the last 5 days.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Some time in late February 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Or perhaps even early March, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Now, I inquired&mdash;I told her that I was coming here today, and that I was
completing my investigation as Oswald's lawyer, and asked her if she would
discuss the matter with me, and she said she would.</p>

<p>I asked her if anyone had asked her not to discuss this matter with me.
At first she seemed reluctant, and she said she was reluctant because I
called her at her place of employment, the Eat Well Cafe in Dallas. I tried
her at home many times before then, but her phone was always busy. I believe
it is a phone which is not her personal one, but is a common phone shared by
others in the building where she resides.</p>

<p>I apologized for calling her at her place of employment. And she seemed
reluctant to talk to me. I asked if anyone had asked her not to talk about
this case with anyone. She said yes, she had been told by the FBI, by Secret
Service agents, and by Dallas police, all three groups, not to discuss anything in
relation to this case, and that by and large she had not.</p>

<p>I told her that somewhere it occurred to me that I had seen an article in
a newspaper in which she described the assailant of Oswald as short, stocky, and
with bushy hair&mdash;I'm sorry, the assailant of Tippit&mdash;as being short, stocky, with
bushy hair. And she said she did talk to a reporter, she thinks, for one of the
Dallas newspapers, the Dallas Times-Herald or the Dallas Morning News&mdash;but
that is the only time she talked to anybody.</p>

<p>I would like to call to the Commission's attention the entire brief narrative
of the entire case, as presented by the district attorney's office at this point, or at
least on the 24th, because it seems to me to be so full of incredible happenings,
that it would be very difficult to submit such a story to a jury by a prosecution
generally.</p>

<p>If everything that the prosecution in this case says is true, one must conclude
that Oswald behaved in a very, very unusual manner from the beginning
to the end.</p>

<p>He decided on Thursday, November 21, that he was going to assassinate the
President, and so he decided to go back to Irving, Tex., to secure a rifle there,
in order to carry out that purpose. He had on his person some $13 when arrested,
and almost $150 in cash in the top drawer of his dresser&mdash;so we can assume that
on Thursday, the 21st, he had roughly that amount of money present.</p>

<p>One can purchase a rifle for less than $13 in many stores in Dallas. There is
no question about that. By using a small portion of that $150, he could have
purchased a rifle absolutely superior to the Italian carbine at home in Irving
in many respects. And there are gun magazines which have had editorials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
dwelling on this question, saying that if Oswald did it with this weapon, and
they do not move into the question of whether or not he did, it was an absolute
miracle, because no one who knew anything about rifles would have chosen such
a decrepit, worthless rifle, as this Italian carbine, manufactured in 1938, for
which there is such pure ammunition. There are a series, I believe, of editorials
in gun magazines proving that Oswald, I think, as a matter of pride, from a
sportsman's viewpoint&mdash;that Oswald was in no way associated with weapons and
did not belong in that category, because he could not have chosen such a weapon.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you give us the citations of one of these magazines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. One is called Gun Magazine. I do not recall the names. But
that is one of them. I am sure there was such an editorial in that one. I will
get the other one and mail those to you also.</p>

<p>But I think there would have to be a more compelling reason for Oswald not
to go home and get that particular inferior rifle if he decided on Thursday to
kill the President. That was the only rifle in the whole world probably that
could be traced to him. One can purchase a rifle in almost any community in
this country, certainly in Dallas, without any notoriety attaching to it, without
giving one's name or address, or having a serial number attached to a receipt
kept by a store indicating who owns that particular rifle.</p>

<p>But here we have Oswald going home to get an inferior rifle, which rifle is the
only rifle in the whole world which can be traced to him, which rifle he is going
to leave behind as a calling card after the assassination is complete.</p>

<p>And so he goes home to Irving, Tex., and he gets this rifle, and he wraps it
up in paper, we are told, and brings it in to the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Now, the rifle can be broken down, I believe, from examining other Italian
carbines. But it would be not much shorter if it was broken down&mdash;perhaps
6 or 7 inches shorter. Evidently, though, he did not do that.</p>

<p>So he took this rifle into the book depository building, which I suggest, gentlemen,
is a most remarkable thing. This was going to be the greatest series of
precautions in the history of the United States to protect an American President.
As we know now, and suspected then, with very good reason, because of the
nature of what had gone before, with reference to public officials in Dallas&mdash;and
here we have a man who has defected to the Soviet Union, who has married a
Russian national, active on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, we see
a discharge less than honorable from the U.S. Marine Corps, who was working
in the building exactly on the Presidential route. Not only is it on the Presidential
route, but it is the building where the automobile is going to have to
clearly slow down because of the sharp turn, sharp left turn, made right in
front of the building.</p>

<p>And despite all of these precautions&mdash;and I have been informed that there
were serious precautions taken in Dallas on that day by the Dallas police and
by others, and that persons who did no more publicly, who did no more ever
politically than to publicly speak in favor of school integration, were followed
that day as potential assassins in Dallas.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Oswald, with that background, is permitted to walk into the
Book Depository Building, directly on the Presidential route, carrying with him
in his hand a full rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us the information on which you base this, about
anyone who merely spoke about school integration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. A reporter for the Dallas Morning News told me that, told
me he was absolutely certain that was so. But before revealing his name, I am
going to have to call him and indicate I am going to do that. I will be happy
to do that. I am glad you are interested in that matter, because I think it is a
most important one.</p>

<p>I suggest that the Federal Bureau of Investigation knew that Oswald worked
at the Texas Book Depository Building, which was on the Presidential route.
An FBI agent by the name of Hosty visited the home of the Paines in Irving,
Tex., sometime during September and October. He visited that home on more
than one occasion. Each of the at least two times that he was there, possibly
three but I am not certain&mdash;but I was told he was there two times&mdash;I know I was
told by Mrs. Paine in the presence of her husband, Michael Paine, that Agent
Hosty was there at least on two occasions&mdash;each time he was there he asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
where Oswald was. Mrs. Paine explained to Agent Hosty, she told me, that
Oswald lived there only on weekends, and that during the week Agent Hosty
could find him at his room in Dallas, where he stayed during the week, or during
the daytime could find him at the Texas Book Depository Building, where he was
an employee. Nevertheless&mdash;and that Oswald would not be found in Irving, Tex.
at the Paine's home during the week. Nevertheless, Agent Hosty returned again
at least one more time to the Paine home in Irving, during the week, during the
day, I believe&mdash;certainly during the week&mdash;and again asked about Oswald, and
again Mrs. Paine told him that he worked at the Book Depository Building, he
would not be there, she said, "As we told you last time he won't be here during
the week. During the daytime during the week you can find him at his job at
the Book Depository Building, and during the nighttime during the week you can
find him at his rooming house in Dallas."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she tell you whether she told him where the rooming house
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I do not believe I asked her that question, and I don't believe she
mentioned that.</p>

<p>Well, to go back to the prosecution narrative, or narrative according to the
facts presented by the prosecution, Oswald was on the sixth floor, fired at the
Presidential limousine, not as the automobile approached the building, when the
automobile came extremely close to the building, so close that possibly even
with that weapon one could have shot occupants of the automobile from that
window&mdash;but it is alleged that Oswald never shot&mdash;it is now alleged that Oswald
never shot when the automobile was right outside of the building, but fired when
the automobile was some 75 yards beyond the building, when the first shot was
fired.</p>

<p>Then Oswald walked the entire floor&mdash;or ran&mdash;the entire floor of the warehouse
to the rear of the building, placing the rifle in between some boxes, but visible,
so that one can see it when one arrives on the floor; went to the rear stairs,
walked down the four flights to the second floor, then to the front of the building
again, where he purchased a Coca-Cola&mdash;made no effort to leave the building
at that time, evidently was going to wait until the building was surrounded by
police before leaving.</p>

<p>He stayed at the top of the stairs near the Coke machine long enough so that
a police officer could come up and place a pistol near him, and Roy Truly, the
director, then intervened indicating that Mr. Oswald was employed at the building
at that time, and the officer then went on to do other things in the building,
including later on, I believe, to find the rifle, if it was the same officer.</p>

<p>Mr. Truly stated that Oswald was quite calm when the officer approached
him on the stairs. He said although he did seem a little concerned about that
pistol being stuck at him&mdash;but otherwise he seemed quite calm at that time.</p>

<p><span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where was this statement made, or testimony given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. By Truly?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This was reported very widely in probably dozens or scores of
newspapers. The New York Times carried that, as did many other publications&mdash;direct
quotations from Truly who was interviewed.</p>

<p>Then the next thing we heard from the prosecution in their opening or closing
statement to the television cameras, after Oswald was killed was that&mdash;the next
we hear of Oswald he was on a bus. Well, if Oswald boarded the bus where
the busdriver claims he did, then Oswald walked a distance, in order to secure
a bus which is going to take him directly back to the Book Depository Building,
which one would think he was trying to flee after assassinating the President.</p>

<p>I would refer you to his story by Hugh Ainsworth in the Dallas Morning News
published during the first week after the assassination. Hugh Ainsworth and
Larry Grove published on November 28 in the Dallas Morning News&mdash;this is
headed "Oswald Planned To Ride By Scene"&mdash;in which there are statements
from the busdriver that&mdash;named C.&nbsp;J. McWatters, in which Mr. McWatters indicates
that Oswald entered the bus at Elm and Griffin, and further indicates that
the bus was going to go seven blocks further west and turn at Houston Street,
exactly the scene of the assassination, or at least the scene of the Texas Book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Depository. So Oswald traveled somehow some seven blocks in order to secure
a bus which is going to take him back to the place that he left.</p>

<p>Now, although I have talked to Mr. Ainsworth, and he tells me that the story
is absolutely correct, and he questioned Mr. McWatters quite thoroughly, and he
will so testify, I believe, if he is asked&mdash;Mr. Ainsworth will&mdash;and the affidavit
which Mr. McWatters signed, or which the busdriver signed, he does not state
that Oswald walked seven blocks and was going to get on a bus which was going
to take him back. Indeed, he states that he picked him up about Elm and
Houston Street, at the Book Depository Building. But the busdriver indicates
that that story in his affidavit is not true. He indicated that after the affidavit
was drawn and signed by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say was not true, Mr. Lane&mdash;which part of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The affidavit. Mr. McWatters indicates that the affidavit in which&mdash;let
me start that again.</p>

<p>There is an affidavit from the busdriver, which I am sure you have, which
shows that according to his statement Oswald came into the bus at Elm and
Houston Street. However, the busdriver since that time has indicated that
Oswald came into the bus seven blocks from Elm and Houston Street, and had
entered a bus which was going to take him to Elm and Houston Street. Elm
and Houston Street of course is the location of the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, when you say since that time he has indicated that, you
mean to you or to someone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. To those two reporters for the Dallas Morning News with whom I
discussed&mdash;one of them&mdash;I discussed this specifically. And he said that every
word in that story is absolutely accurate, that he went to see the busdriver, and
had a prolonged interview with him, and went over this in great detail with him.
I think these two reporters will testify as to what the busdriver told them in
their interview with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But they have not published this later story that you are telling
about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, they have. That is the date that I gave you. The Dallas
Morning News, on Thursday, November 28, under the headline "Oswald Planned
To Ride By Scene".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you want to leave that with us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I wonder if copies can be made of everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Then I will be happy to leave it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The story you were just referring to in the Dallas Morning News
is Commission Exhibit 343.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 343 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Well, now, Oswald allegedly had shot the President and has walked some,
talked to an officer, was calm, walked some seven blocks to find a bus which
was going to take him back to where he left, and then got off and got&mdash;entered
into a taxi after he had walked some two blocks from where he left the bus.
And this taxi he entered of course a minute before the President was shot, if
the taxi driver's log is accurate&mdash;after Oswald had done all these things, after
allegedly shooting the President and the Governor.</p>

<p>Then the taxi driver drove him directly past his own home, according to the
statement and&mdash;past Oswald's Dallas rooming house, until he arrived at a
scene about a half a mile beyond Oswald's house, where Oswald then left
the taxi, and then walked or ran home to secure a jacket&mdash;leaving behind,
although one would assume he is now giving considering to escaping, the $150 in
the dresser drawer, and taking just his jacket with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Which dresser drawer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. This is in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Not at the Paine's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not at the Paine's. I do not know if there was money at the
Paine's, but if he had money there, he left that behind the night before, knowing
he was going <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But the $150 you are speaking of was in his rooming house at
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have any affidavit or information in support of that
statement about the $150?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I do not have an affidavit. I have the statement of a reporter who
was told that&mdash;he was told this by a police officer who was present when the
money was found in the Dallas rooming house. I have his statement. I can
again ask for his permission to release that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you do that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Mr. Chairman&mdash;perhaps it has been done, but I think it would
be proper in all cases in which he has referred to conversations that he has
had with individuals who made statements to him about some aspect of this
matter, and whose names he has not identified, that if he could give to the
Commission in all of those cases the names of the individuals who gave him
this information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I mean at sometime&mdash;don't you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, sir, it would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes, sir. I think there are only two occasions where I indicated
I had to check the source, and one is the name of the rifle association board
member whose name I will be happy to give to you, but I just do not recall it&mdash;my
office has that.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I did not remember that you gave the name of this individual
who told you that some policeman had told him that he had been present when
the $150 was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; that is one.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you give that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; I did not give that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said you were going to ask him his permission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; that's correct.</p>

<p>Then Oswald took a taxi, which took him approximately a half mile beyond
his own house, his own room in Dallas, and he either walked or ran back to
get his jacket&mdash;although it was a very warm day in Dallas. That day Mrs.
Kennedy said later on that, reviewing the moment before the President was
shot&mdash;she said she saw this overpass ahead and looked forward to being under it
for a moment because there would be some brief shade to protect them from
the powerful sun that day.</p>

<p>Well, Oswald ran home to get his jacket. He left the house, saw a police
car parked, went up to the police car, according to the affidavit of Mrs. Markham,
leaned on the car, and when the officer came out, he shot him to death, and
then he went to the movies. And in the movies, and just before he went into
the Texas Theatre, he was so extremely agitated that a gentleman on the outside
of the theatre&mdash;I think his name is John Brewer&mdash;I am not certain&mdash;you
have that affidavit, I am sure&mdash;indicated that Oswald was acting very agitated,
the cashier made the same statement, and changing from seat to seat. The
police were called and he was arrested.</p>

<p>Of course, one would wonder why Oswald, who might have thought that
he had made his getaway while in the Texas Theatre unobserved, would
become so extremely agitated, when just a moment after he allegedly shot
the President and the Governor, with the policeman charging up the stairs,
pointing a pistol at him, about to arrest him for these two terrible crimes,
he was calm, according to Mr. Truly, but he became agitated only when
he thought he had secured his getaway.</p>

<p>I think those of us who saw, as we all did, I guess, Oswald on television
in his brief appearance would conclude that he seemed, even while in custody
and charged with these two crimes, somewhat calm under the circumstances&mdash;calm
when charged with the assassination, calm a moment after killing the
President, when a policeman pointed a pistol at him, but agitated only in
the theatre, and just before going to the theatre when he might have concluded
that he was then in the clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
I would just like to conclude on this note.</p>

<p>I hope the Commission will give consideration to my request, which the
Commission has answered, but which again I would like at this time to
renew. That is, that I be permitted, at the request of Mrs. Oswald, the
mother of the accused defendant, really, before this Commission's hearing,
to represent his interests here, to have access to the material which you
have access to, and the right to present witnesses.</p>

<p>It is not usual for an attorney representing a party to be given an opportunity
to testify, which is quite unusual&mdash;but rather to be given the opportunity
to present witnesses and to cross-examine them. It has generally
been my role in criminal cases. Never before have I testified in behalf of a
client.</p>

<p>If it is the Commission's position that this is not a trial in any respect,
and therefore Oswald is not entitled to counsel, that is the position with
which I would like to respectfully offer a dissent.</p>

<p>The fact that Oswald is not going to have a real trial flows only from
his death, and he is not responsible with that having taken place. Every
right belonging to an American citizen charged with a crime was taken
from him up to and including his life.</p>

<p>I think now that that episode is completed, hopefully never to reappear
ever again in our history, or anything close to it&mdash;I think it would be
proper to permit him to have counsel before the Commission, counsel who
can function on his behalf in terms of cross-examining evidence and presenting
witnesses. If it is the Commission's position now that he is entitled
to counsel, and the Commission will appoint counsel, then I ask the Commission
to consider that the Constitutional right to counsel involves the right
to counsel of one's choice, or in the event of the death of a party, to counsel
of the choice of the surviving members of the family.</p>

<p>If Marina Oswald, the widow, sought to have counsel represent her husband
I would think&mdash;here&mdash;I would think that would cause a conflict and a problem,
if the widow and also the mother made the same request. But as I understand
it no request has been made by the widow, who has indicated to
the press that she believes her husband is guilty, and through her former
business agent, Mr. Martin, who I am told was secured for her by the Secret
Service as a business agent, she indicated that even a trial which might
prove he was innocent, she would still be sure he was guilty, and has indicated
since that time no desire to my knowledge to secure counsel for her
husband, her late husband, before the Commission.</p>

<p>I think, then, the mother would, in almost any jurisdiction, be the next
person to make a decision in this area, and the mother has made a decision,
as you know. She has retained me to represent the rights and interests
of her son.</p>

<p>I think under those circumstances it would be proper for the Commission to
permit me to participate.</p>

<p>This, of course, is not a jury trial. With all due respect to the integrity
and background of each of the members of the Commission, I suggest
that it is not the function of the trying body to appoint counsel, or the
jury to appoint counsel, but in our society it is just the reverse; it is the
function of defense counsel to participate in determining who the jury
should be.</p>

<p>Many criminal lawyers, very noted counsel, would probably seek to excuse
certain&mdash;and again no disrespect at all is meant to the background of members
of this Commission&mdash;but defense counsel generally seeks to excuse as jurors
those who are in any way associated with the Government in a criminal
case. And here we have the Government appointing the jury, and then the
jury picking counsel, who also is Government connected at this time. I
in no way wish to raise the question of the integrity of any of the members
of the Commission or counsel or anyone else, or their ability. But that
truism about equality has some meaning in terms of impartiality&mdash;everyone
is impartial to some people, and more impartial to other people. And
counsel, in order to function, I believe, must be totally independent and totally
committed to the responsibility of representing his client.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
But above all, he must be secured by someone who has the ability to
speak for the deceased, in this case his mother and his wife. And under
those circumstances, I renew my request that I be permitted to, at the
request of Lee Oswald's mother, who survives him&mdash;to function before this
Commission as counsel on his behalf.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Lane, I must advise you that the Commission, as you
already know, has considered your request and has denied it. It does not consider
you as the attorney for Lee Oswald. Now, this is not for any discussion.
We are not going to argue it. You have had your say, and I will just answer.</p>

<p>Lee Oswald left a widow. She is his legal representative. She is represented
by counsel. This Commission is cooperating with her in any way she may
request. If anyone else wants to present any evidence to this Commission, they
may do so. But it is the view and the wish&mdash;the will of the Commission&mdash;that
no one else shall be entitled to participate in the work and the deliberations
of the Commission.</p>

<p>We asked you to come here today because we understood that you did have
evidence. We are happy to receive it. We want every bit of evidence that
you have. You may present anything that you wish to us. But you are not
to be a participant in the work of the Commission. I assume you have some
questions you would like to ask Mr. Lane, Mr. Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, sir. Do you have any affidavits that you would like to
submit to the Commission? I understood at one time you had some affidavits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, I do have some affidavits. They are not originals&mdash;they
are photostatic copies of affidavits taken by the Dallas police and on file in the
Dallas district attorney's office. Now&mdash;including the paraffin test which I made
reference to.</p>

<p>Now, if the Commission does not have copies of those, I would like to be
so informed and I will see what I can do. I assume the Commission has copies
of all those documents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes. Do you have anything beyond that that you care to submit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I have the various statements which I have made reference to
from Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Markham, Mr. Klein, Mr. Ryder. But I have given
you the essence of those statements. If you are interested in pursuing that,
I think it might be best to call them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I am interested if there was anything beyond what you have
given us, Mr. Lane. And if you say you have given us the substance, then I take
it that is complete as far as it could be of assistance to us, except our going
directly to the witness. Is that what you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, do you have any witnesses that you would like to present
for the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, I would like&mdash;I do not know that I would be able to do that,
frankly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, would you have any that you suggest that we should
interview, bring before the Commission, that you have not presented up to this
time in your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; there is no one who I know of other than those names I have
given, and two other persons whose permission I am going to have to secure
in reference to other matters, and hopefully they will be willing to not only
allow their names to be used, but to come forward and testify, if you wish to hear
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, is there any documentary evidence beyond which you
have submitted that you would like to submit to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not beyond what I have submitted or made reference to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In regard to the paraffin that you have referred to, do you have
any particular materials or anything you want to refer the Commission to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. To that particular test taken by Mr. Anderson on November 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anything beyond that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; not at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, I understand at one time you referred to some meeting
in the Carousel Club a week or so before the assassination. Do you have any
material on that or any information?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything you would care to present to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. I have been informed&mdash;and this is the source I will have
to check with again in order to secure his <span class="locked">testimony&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You will advise us if you are permitted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. But I can tell you the substance&mdash;that a meeting took place
on November 14, 1963, in the Carousel Club between Officer Tippit and Bernard
Weissman, Mr. Weissman being the gentleman who placed a full-page advertisement
in the Dallas Morning News which was printed on November 22, asking
a series of questions of President Kennedy. It was addressed "Welcome to
Dallas, President Kennedy. Why have you traded the Monroe Doctrine for
spirit of Moscow. Why has Gus Hall and the Communist Party endorsed your
1964 election" and such matter. I think these two give a rather clear indication
of the kind of advertisement that it was. And I have been informed that Mr.
Weissman and Officer Tippit and a third person were present there. I have
been given the name of the third person. But for matters which I will make
plain to the Commission, I will be pleased to give you the name of the third
person as given to me, but not in the presence of the press. I would rather
do that in executive session&mdash;that one piece of testimony.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is satisfactory to do that, if you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything else about that incident that you know and
want to tell the Commission at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is the entire story, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That they were there for more than 2 hours conferring&mdash;these three
persons.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Your information does not&mdash;is not to the effect as to what
they were conferring on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; they did not hear that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I am not suggesting, Mr. Lane, that you have been selective
about what you have told the Commission and what you have not told, but I
do wish to make the inquiry as to whether there is any information you might
have that the Commission should be informed of as to other people that you
might have interviewed in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I have given the Commission at this time everything that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything about the palm prints that you can tell us in
addition to what you have given us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not in addition to what I have said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, I will ask you generally&mdash;is there anything in addition
to what you have said that you would like to tell the Commission at this time
that has any bearing upon this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. All I can say in reference to that, Mr. Rankin, is that I am practically
engaged in this project by myself, which means I am extremely limited.
This is not my profession&mdash;investigator. I am an attorney. And there are
many leads which I have followed, which have led me nowhere at all, obviously.
Before finding Mrs. Markham or before finding Mrs. Hill, there were many
other persons I talked to who were not even present, who I have heard were
present. But there are still large numbers, probably at this point hundreds of
leads which I have heard of, and which I have not yet been able to trace or to
check through. I do not think it would be constructive just to tell you all of
the things I have heard, because most of them are patently untrue, and they
just require a great deal of work. But I will continue to do that, and should I
come across any material which might in any way interest you, I will certainly
either write to you for the purpose of presenting it to you through the mail in
affidavit form, if you prefer, or indicate that I will be available to come and
testify again if you prefer that.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Lane, your client, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, when she
was testifying before us, told us that she had sold some pictures to the press
and she wanted the originals of all the pictures that she presented to us, because
she said they were of great financial value to her. Do you know what sales
she has made concerning pictures such as you have shown us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. In terms of the picture with the rifle, you mean, for example?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, we might start with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. She has never seen such a picture, she has informed me, of Lee
Harvey Oswald with the rifle&mdash;except after they had been published. She
never had any knowledge of such pictures, and had never seen them.</p>

<p>I do not really represent Marguerite Oswald. She has retained me to represent
the interests of her son. And so in her business dealings in terms of
her sale of pictures and articles, I have not represented her. I believe she has
a literary agent or perhaps even another lawyer&mdash;I don't know. But she has
retained me to represent her son's interests, not to represent her at all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Of course, we have conferred. But I do not have that information.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr Lane, I have a further question. Have you ever been prevented
by any law enforcement officer from interviewing anyone concerning
this matter when you wished to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, I would say that I have been prevented by the statements
made by the law enforcement persons or agents to the individual, that he should
not talk to anyone about this case, that it is a secret matter. As I have indicated,
Mr. <span class="locked">Klein&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have described those cases, have you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I have also spoken to a reporter who is employed by a Dallas newspaper,
who informed me that he sought to question more than 150 in the area,
and that many of those persons informed him that they were ordered by the
FBI not to talk to anyone about this case, and that almost none of the witnesses
would talk with him about the case, and that some of them, when he asked the
reason that they were not talking to him, it was "Was this because you have
been told by the FBI?"&mdash;and he indicated they were not even allowed to answer
that question. But many of them told him that the FBI or the Secret Service
ordered them not to talk. In no other respect have I been interfered with to
my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have the name of that reporter&mdash;can you reveal that
to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I cannot reveal it at this time, but I am hopeful you will permit
me to. He is one of the reporters I referred to earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator, do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. No; I have no questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Rhyne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Mr. Chief Justice&mdash;I wanted to ask Mr. Lane, on his inquiry about
what happened to Oswald during the 48 hours he was under detention&mdash;you suggested
that the Commission make an inquiry into whether his civil rights were
denied. Do you have any information on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. I saw what happened&mdash;I read in the newspapers and heard
on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. It looked to me that most of the material presented here today
was really in the newspapers. You are merely repeating what someone else
has said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I don't think that is an accurate characterization of my testimony
at all, sir. For example, I told you before of conversations that I have had&mdash;I
know you listened intently&mdash;I told you of conversations that I had with Mr.
Klein. I told you of conversations I had with Miss Hill, who is probably the
closest eyewitness to the assassination, with Miss Woodward, who is perhaps
the second or third closest witness to the assassination, with Dial Ryder, with
at least two or three other persons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. But on this one point, with respect to denial of any civil rights or
protection of civil rights during this 48-hour period, you say that is all in the
newspaper stories?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No. What I meant by that response was that the basic denial that
I was discussing was the development of the case publicly against him, so that
it would be impossible in securing a jury panel to secure 12 jurors probably
anywhere in this country who had not reached a conclusion, first of all. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
secondly, obviously the death of the accused, which I know is a matter for the
Commission's inquiry already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. I notice that you said your investigation was incomplete. So
I just wanted to be sure that I understood what you meant with respect to this
48-hour detention period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; I have no knowledge over and above that that I could give
you in that area.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Murray, do you have any questions you would like to
ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>. No; I have none, Mr. Chief Justice, at this time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mr. Lane, if any evidence should come to your attention
in the future, would you be willing to convey the information to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I certainly would, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will appreciate it if you would. Thank you for your
attendance.</p>

<p>We will adjourn at this time.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:35 p.m., the President's Commission adjourned, and reconvened

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The session will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you proceed, Mr. Lane, in executive session now, to describe
the names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The third name that I was informed&mdash;the person that I was informed
was there, the third person, is named Jack Ruby. It was my feeling, of
course, while his case was pending it would not be proper to comment on that
in the presence of the press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean the third person in the group apparently conferring?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. Tippit, Weissman, and Ruby.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Have you made any public statement of this kind before on
this subject&mdash;about this meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not about Ruby&mdash;about a meeting between Weissman and Tippit,
yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. But you never named Ruby publicly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No; I have not. I shall not.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see. Do you know any way by which we might corroborate
that meeting&mdash;the fact that it was held?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I am going this evening to see, or tomorrow&mdash;I will try this evening
first&mdash;to see if I can secure permission by my informant to reveal his name,
and I hope he will be willing to come forward and testify as to what took place.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission would like to know it, if you can do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes; I shall inform you as soon as I discover that. I would like
very much for the Commission to have that information. Can I indicate to my
informant that the matter can be so raised so that his name will not be known
to anyone other than the Commission?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, sir; you may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That will be extremely helpful.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. If you can think of any way that can be corroborated, it
would be most helpful to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman, you just got in as we are about to adjourn.
Mr. Lane was telling us of one piece of information that he had concerning a
meeting that was held at the Carousel Nightclub, about a week, did you <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. About a week before the assassination, at which the man
who financed this full-page article in the paper, Dallas paper, this morning, concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
President Kennedy, and Officer Tippit, and he told us in private here&mdash;he
didn't want to mention it before the press&mdash;Jack Ruby. And he tells us that
he will try to find out from his informant more about that, and if he possibly
can deliver the information to us.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask one question?</p>

<p>I assume from what you have said you wouldn't be able to answer it, but was
there any reason ascribed for the presence of Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. My informant does not know the reason.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Or Ruby, with Weissman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. My informant does not know that information.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask a question, Mr. Chief Justice? When did
this information come to your attention, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Some weeks ago.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you consider the informant a reliable, responsible
person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. I cannot vouch, of course, for the information personally,
but I believe the informant is a reliable and a responsible person.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would your informant be willing, as far as you know&mdash;be
willing to testify and give the Commission this information directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I am going to try to arrange that this evening. The Chief Justice
has indicated that his name would not be known if he did that, and that I did
not know that I could make that statement to him before now. I hope that will
be decisive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Is there anything further, gentlemen?</p>

<p>If <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask, Mr. Chairman, are we going to have a schedule
laid out, are we going to have a meeting of the Commission where maybe we
will know what the schedule is in the next week or 10 days or 2 weeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We have a draft now.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We have a draft for you to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Perhaps I should withdraw at this time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane, thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, the Commission will be in order. Will you
be seated, please?</p>

<p>Would you state the names of the witnesses who are to be heard today,

and we will call first, Mr. who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman is our first witness.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Kellerman. Gentlemen, I want to announce that
today it will be necessary for me to spend practically all of the morning with
the Supreme Court, and in my absence Congressman Ford will conduct the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. My name is Roy H. Kellerman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By whom are you employed, Mr. Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am employed as a special agent for the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am 48 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; I am married and have two daughters; their
ages are 20 and 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Bethesda, Md.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your current duty station with the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. My current duty station is assistant special agent in
charge of the White House detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you been with the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is my 23d year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you sketch in a general outline what your duties have
been with the Secret Service since the time you started with them, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I was appointed an agent with the Secret Service in
Detroit, Mich., the 19th of December 1941. I was transferred to Washington,
D.C., the field office, on February 9, 1942. Prior to that I had a 30-day assignment
in the office of Cincinnati, Ohio, temporarily. I worked in the Washington
field office from the 9th of February 1942 until the middle of March
1942, whereby I was temporarily transferred to the White House detail.
This transfer became permanent, effective, I believe it was, the 17th of April
or the latter part of April in 1942, still as a special agent.</p>

<p>At the White House detail we work on shifts around the clock, protecting
the President and his family. I was a member of one of those three shifts.
Presently, these shifts change on a two-weekly basis, from 8 to 4, 4 to midnight,
and midnight to 8. I remained on the White House detail until February 7,
1951, when I was transferred to Indianapolis, Ind. Prior to that time I had
received enough seniority whereby I grew up on this shift from the bottom to
the top, and was in charge of one of the shifts prior to my departure to Indianapolis.
This was fieldwork in Indiana.</p>

<p>On February 1, 1955, I was transferred back to the White House detail.
On my return I was comparable to like, let's say, the No. 2 man of a shift.
I was not in charge of it.</p>

<p>From 1955, I believe a couple of years later a vacancy occurred, a top man of
that shift left and I received his position. That title was assistant to the special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
agent in charge. You at that time governed each man on your shift. You were
in charge of him.</p>

<p>On October 1 of 1962 a vacancy was opened in the three top officials of the
White House detail, which are comprised of, let me say, the special agent in
charge, who has two assistants; one vacancy occurred. It was the oldest man
on the White House detail; it was given to me and that is why today I have the
title of assistant special agent in charge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, since you brought us up to 1955, have your duties remained
the same since that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I should bring you up to 1964. In 1955, I was transferred
back to the White House detail, remained on that status on shift work until
1962, whereas I am now an assistant special agent in charge, which duties are
the overseeing and the complete responsibility of the entire White House detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your educational background, <span class="locked">Mr.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am a high school graduate only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What year did you graduate from high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. 1933.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your activities between graduation from high school
and the time you joined the Secret Service, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In October of 1937 I completed the training with the Michigan
State Police. I was sworn in as a trooper. I remained with the Michigan State
Police until December 18, 1941, when I resigned and was appointed to the U.S.
Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How were you employed or occupied from the time of graduation
from high school until the time you joined the Michigan State Police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. 1933 there wasn't too much work; 1935 was my first work
with the Dodge Corp. of the Chrysler people in Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you work there, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Three years, off and on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You described in a general way the organization of the Secret
Service on the White House protective detail. Who is the special agent in
charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Gerald A. Behn, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he the special agent in charge back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. He was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many shifts are there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Three shifts, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And approximately how many men are assigned to each shift?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Ten men on each shift, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your specific duties back on November 22 of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. My specific duty, gentlemen, on the 22d of November of 1963,
I was in charge of the detail for this trip of President Kennedy, for the trip to
Texas in those 2 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you personally make the trip to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I rode on the President's plane on the entire tour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline in a general way the times of departure and
arrival on the trip to Texas up until the morning of November 22, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I just don't have the time we left Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Without the precise times; just in a general way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. All right. We departed in the morning from Washington.
Our first stop was in San Antonio, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which morning was that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It was November 21; it was at San Antonio, Tex., that we
picked up the then Vice President Johnson. The two people continued on this
tour of the State in separate planes. During our stay in San Antonio, we then
flew from San Antonio to Houston, Tex. There were ceremonies there, and the
program there which had been set up. From Houston we flew into Fort Worth,
Tex., where we remained overnight on November 21.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Texas Hotel, it was a little after 11 o'clock in the evening.
There were no activities until the following morning, November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did the activities start the following morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On November 22, the activities started at around 8:25 in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
morning when the President, accompanied by the then Vice President Johnson,
and a few congressional leaders walked out the front door, across this street
which was a parking lot, and a few minutes' speech was made to the gathering
there. It was a light drizzle at the time. From there we returned to the hotel
and he attended a breakfast given by the chamber of commerce and, I believe
it was, a citizens group of Fort Worth. On completion of the breakfast he returned
to his suite. The weather was then changing. It had quit raining and
it looked like it was going to break out and be a real beautiful day. In the
neighborhood of 10 o'clock in the morning I received a call from Mr. Lawson,
Special Agent Lawson, who had the advance from Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Lawson was with the Secret Service, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; he is. He asked me to determine whether the
bubbletop car that the President would ride in in Dallas that day should have
the top down or remain up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me interrupt you there for just a minute, Mr. Kellerman.
I show you a photograph which has been marked as Commission Exhibit No.
344. Are you able to identify that picture and the automobile in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; this is the 1961 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible
bubbletop. It is a special car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For the purpose of the record, how many doors does that car
have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This vehicle has four doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in the posture of the picture identified as Commission
Exhibit 344, is the top up or down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The top is down, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what top does that automobile have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This top is a plastic top. From the rear of the passenger
all the way to the windshield there are four sections of plastic glass. The
one that comes over the top of the passengers in the back seat, two little sections
that come over the two doors, and one over the driver and passenger in
the front seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what way is that attached, if any, to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Securely bolted, screwed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I ask that the Exhibit 344 be introduced
formally in evidence, please?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It will be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 344 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 345.
Are you able to tell us what that depicts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; this is the same vehicle as mentioned in 344. The
difference being the top is up and there is a covering, a cloth covering that also
fits over this plastic top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And Exhibit No. 345 is taken from what angle, Mr. Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. From the rear, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As contrasted with Exhibit No. 344, which is taken from what
angle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is from the right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I ask that Exhibit 345 be introduced, if the Commission please.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 345 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 346,
Mr. Kellerman, and ask you if you can tell us what that depicts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This picture depicts the interior of this same automobile.
It has a rear solid seat; there are two other jump seats that can be folded forward
in the rear and the complete solid front seat for the driver and passenger.
This is the same vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe what, if anything, is present between the
front seat and the rear seat area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. This metal partition that is erected in back of
the driver, between the driver and the passengers in the rear seat, is a metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
framework that goes over the car. It has four holes in it. These holes are
utilized by the President for parades. As an example, say it was used in Washington
where you had an official visitor, and in using one of the streets here as
your parade route, he and his guest would stand in this car where the people
could view them a little better than sitting in the rear seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where is that metal bar positioned with respect to the front
seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is positioned over the front seat; the top of this bar would
be 4 or 5 inches over my head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it directly over the back portion of the front seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. Directly over the front seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you describe it as 4 or 5 inches over your head. Can you
give us an estimate of the distance above the top of the front seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Oh, I am guessing in the neighborhood of 15, 18 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the width of that metal bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The bar, 4 to 6 inches, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you tell us approximately how wide the automobile itself is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to the automobile, are there any running boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There are no running boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any place on the car where someone can stand up and
ride as it proceeds in motion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; on the rear of the vehicle, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many such positions are there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There is a step on each side of the spare tire, one man on
each one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there any facility for holding on with a man riding in those
positions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; there is a metal arm erected on the trunk where
a man can hold on while standing on the rear of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>May it please the Commission, I move that Exhibit 346 be introduced in
evidence.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It will be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 346 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With reference to the bubble top which you have heretofore
described, of what is that composed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is composed of plastic, clear plastic substance. Its use
would be for a weather matter whereby the President or his occupants can see
out. It is not an enclosed car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it bulletproof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is not bulletproof.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it bullet resistant in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It's not bullet resistant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you describe in a general way at this point what efforts,
if any, have been made to obtain a bulletproof clear top for the President's
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Presently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Presently or heretofore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am going to have to go in the present day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This same vehicle, I understand, is being completed with a
bullet-resistant top and sides.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you explain the difference between bullet resistant
and the existing kind of the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I can't; I really can't. I have been behind on this thing
and I am at a loss for a better answer.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could the present top deflect in any way, destroy the
accuracy of a shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This would be a guess, Mr. Congressman. I would think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
that it would be deterred for, let's say, the velocity of a missile coming in at
great speed, I think it would deter it; I don't think it would eliminate&mdash;it still
would enter the top.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am sure; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But as far as you know the top that was available would
not impede the projectile? Do you know whether or not it would deflect its
accuracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Well, I have tried to study that, sir. The angle of the back
as an example which is, what degree I don't recall, hoping that&mdash;of course, it
was now known to be an upshot into the vehicle hoping that it would deter its
force and so forth, but I really don't know. I kind of doubt it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, in describing the top as being not bulletproof and
not bullet resistant, state whether you are describing the top which they are
currently working on or the top which was present at the time of November
22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is the top that they are currently working on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, as to the bubble top which accompanied this car on November 22, 1963,
was that bulletproof or bullet resistant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It was not; neither.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not an effort is being made at the
present time to develop a bullet-resistant or bulletproof top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you personally familiar with the progress of that effort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how the President's automobile was transported
from Washington, D.C., to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. The President's vehicle was transported to San
Antonio by cargo aircraft. It was flown to San Antonio a day before the President
arrived. It was then flown from San Antonio to Dallas, where it was used
on November 22. This vehicle was not used in the other two stops at Houston
and Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say cargo <span class="locked">aircraft&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Like a C-130, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. You are right, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, what were the President's activities, if you know
immediately prior to the time he departed from Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Might I ask just one question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you know whether or not prior to November 22 the President's
car had ever been equipped with a top which had the capacity to stop or
deflect a bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Never had been, Senator.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. There was none in existence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, what were the President's activities immediately
before departing from Fort Worth on the morning of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. First he walked from the hotel across the street, spoke to a
group that were in a parking lot, with other congressional people there in Texas.
From there he walked right into the hotel and entered the ballroom where a breakfast
was held, given to him by the chamber of commerce and, I believe, the
citizens group in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>From there he returned to his suite because there was time left before his
departure for Dallas. It was up there in the neighborhood of 10 o'clock in the
morning that Special Agent Lawson called me from Dallas asking me to verify
whether the top should be put on&mdash;should remain on the President's car or
should be taken off due to the change of weather. It had been raining slightly
in Dallas at that time. I said, "One moment and I will check with you one way
or the other."</p>

<p>As I said earlier, the weather was clearing in Fort Worth; it was going to
be a nice day. I asked Mr. Kenneth O'Donnell, who is President Kennedy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
appointment secretary: "Mr. O'Donnell," I said, "the weather; it is slightly
raining in Dallas, predictions of clearing up. Do you desire to have the bubbletop
on the President's car or do you, or would you desire to have it removed for this
parade over to the Trade Mart?"</p>

<p>His instructions to me were, "If the weather is clear and it is not raining,
have that bubbletop off," and that is exactly what I relayed to Mr. Lawson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, at about what time did President Kennedy depart from
Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We were airborne from Fort Worth at 11:20 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what plane were you airborne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In the President's special plane, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive in that plane in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We arrived in Dallas, Love Field, at 11:40 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe in a general way what President Kennedy's activities
were at Love Field, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very well. May I add this: Again I said there were two
planes in this program. The then Vice President Johnson would be in a separate
plane. He would land ahead of us by a minute or two, all right. He is in
Dallas by the time we arrive at 11:40 a.m. As we are spotted on the apron at
Love Field and when the ramp is pulled forward, the Vice President, then Vice
President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson, together with a selected group of people
would form a reception committee from the end of the ramp straight out to
where the motorcade was in place.</p>

<p>At 11:40, as I said, the President and Mrs. Kennedy left that plane, met
these people. As we finished greeting these folks here, there was an elderly
lady wheeled up in a wheelchair; her name I do not know; the both of them
met her. By this time the people are starting to get in their automobiles for
this trip into town. The President then noticed that there was quite a gathering
of people at this airport in back of a fenced area, and, with her, they both
walked over to this crowded area and started shaking hands and greeting these
people who had been there perhaps some time before we got in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By "her", who do you mean, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mrs. Kennedy; I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would you estimate the crowd to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In the thousands; I would say there were two, three, four
thousand people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long did the greeting of the crowd at Love
Field last, Mr. Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Fifteen minutes. The motorcade left Love Field at 11:55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how many cars were there in that motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. At least 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the first car in line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The first car in line, sir, was what we call the police pilot
car. The duties of these police officers in that car&mdash;they would drive ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you personally know who was in that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far ahead of the regular motorcade were they to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They could be several blocks ahead of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the general purpose of that pilot car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The purpose of that pilot car is to clear the roadway and
instruct the officers along the route that the President is in motion and coming
in back of them. Next you will find a small group of motorcycles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how many motorcycles there were in Dallas on
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you tell us what the custom is with respect to motorcycles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; those motorcycles that would be in back of that
police car were to assist any officers along the way in any disturbance that
they would run into before we got to that point, or secondly, in the event that
we needed them back on our car they could be called, utilized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the next car in line?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The next car is the lead car. That car on that day was
driven by Chief Curry of the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>His occupants in that car was Special Agent Winston Lawson, who was carrying
a portable radio with him. Also in this car was Special Agent in Charge
Verne Sorrels, in charge of our Dallas office. The other occupant, I believe,
was a deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it Sheriff Decker, perhaps, of Dallas County?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The name doesn't reach me, sir; I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You described a radio. Will you tell us a little more fully
what radio transmission there was in the motorcade, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. This lead car which Mr. Lawson was in has a
portable radio. The President's car is next. This is equipped with a permanent
set radio on the same frequency as that gentleman up front. The next car is
our Secret Service followup car which has a permanent installation. The
Secret Service car, as I say, is equipped with a permanent installation which
connects the President's car and the lead car. The next car in back of our
Secret Service car was the then Vice President Johnson. The Secret Service
agent in that car had a portable radio that he could read all three of us ahead.
His car following was a small Secret Service followup car, and they, too, had
a portable set, which could read all four.</p>

<p>So we had a net of five on our own frequency. In the police cars they had
their own city police frequency radios.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many frequencies were used by your own network?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. One.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you have an alternative frequency, emergency frequency?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; we do. We have two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What automobile came behind the lead automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe the occupants of that car, indicating their positions,
if you can, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes. The President&mdash;President Kennedy sat on the right
rear seat. Next to him on the left seat was Mrs. Kennedy. On the right jump
seat in front of President Kennedy was Governor Connally. On the left jump
seat in front of Mrs. Kennedy was Mrs. Connally. I sat on the right passenger
seat of the driver's seat, and Special Agent William Greer drove the vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far were you behind the lead car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No more than two or three car lengths.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What is that? I didn't hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No more than two or three car lengths, Senator Cooper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What car immediately followed the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Our own Secret Service followup car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What kind of a car was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is a 1956 Cadillac, four-door touring car with the top
down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that also a special automobile flown in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is a special automobile, flown in with the President's
car; yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who were the occupants of that car, indicating their positions
in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. All during this ride in from Love Field Special Agent Sam
Kinney was the driver of this automobile. The assistant to the Special Agent
in Charge Emory Roberts was sitting in the front seat, the passenger side.
This car has running boards. Standing on the front of the left running board
was Special Agent Clinton Hill. In back of him on the rear of that same running
board on that side was Special Agent William McIntyre. On the right
running board standing forward was Special Agent John Ready, and standing
in back of him on the rear of the right running board was Special Agent Paul
Landis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did that automobile have jump seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This automobile has jump seats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what people occupied the jump seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It was occupied by Mr. Kenneth O'Donnell, who was the
appointment secretary of President Kennedy, and Mr. Dave Powers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know which sat on which side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. O'Donnell sat on the left; Mr. Powers sat on the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was in the back seat of that automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The back seat of that automobile on the right side was
Special Agent George Hickey, and on the left side Special Agent Glen Bennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How were the special agents in the followup car armed, if at
all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Each agent carries his own gun. This is a 4-inch revolver
on their person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that apply to you and Mr. Greer as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other arms in the President's followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; in this followup car we have what is now known
as an AR-15. This is a rifle, and it is on all movements; this vehicle is out
of the case; it won't be shown; it could be laying flat on the floor, but she is
ready to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, how far behind the President's car did the Presidential
followup car follow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not knowing how far it was behind, I would say, from the
practice of that driver that he has, five feet would be a maximum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What car was in the motorcade immediately behind the President's
followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That was Vice President Johnson's car then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What kind of a car was that on that particular day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This was a Lincoln four-door Continental convertible. This
was a four-door car, with no top on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that a special car, also, or is that obtained on the market?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is not a special car; it is a car that is on the market.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What car followed the Vice President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The car following his car was a police car. It was driven
by a member of the Dallas Police Force, or I just don't recall. I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have personal knowledge or detail of the occupants of
the Vice President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Special Agent Rufus Youngblood sat in the front seat on
the right side. In back of him on the right side and the rear was the then
Vice President Johnson. Next to him was Mrs. Johnson, and next to Mrs.
Johnson was Senator Yarborough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Vice President Johnson seated on the right side or the
left side of the rear seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On the right side, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there jump seats in the Vice President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the identity of the driver of the Vice President's
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That was Mr. Hurchel Jacks. He is a Dallas police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Might he be a Texas State police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; you are right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the identity of all of the individuals in the Vice
President's followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not the driver. The agents, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who were they, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Special Agent Thomas L. Johns, Special Agent Warren
Taylor, and I believe that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to indicate their precise positions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what car, if you know, followed the Vice President's
followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That was car&mdash;as an example, car No. 1, which would be
a congressional car; the occupants I do not know at the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And behind that car, describe in a general way the balance of
the motorcade, if you will, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. All right. The balance of the motorcade, the back of that
car No. 1 which would be the congressional people would be two press cars, one
covering the wire people, and one would be the photographic group. Then you
would have a series of guest cars, and then a press bus. And then a police car
followup, bringing up the entire motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You described the motorcycles which followed the pilot car.
Were there any other motorcycles in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; we had four other motorcycles opposite the back
wheel of the President's vehicle, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were those on both sides or on each side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On each side; two on each side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other motorcycles in the balance of the
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what speed did the motorcade proceed at the various times
en route, say, from Love Field down to the downtown section of Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we left Love Field, the driveway from this apron on the
field was sort of a winding thing, and there were many people that gathered
on the roadside to view him as they passed. I don't think we traveled more
than 12 to 15 miles until we left the airport apron proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Twelve to fifteen miles per hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Per hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Then, as we were in the opening between there and the city
limits of Dallas, we could have gone 25 to 30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the size of the crowd at that specific point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Nothing in between then until we hit the outskirts of the
city. Of course, then you got into a residential, a school, area where all the
people were out on the curb line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the speed when you reached that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Then we would reduce the speed down to 15 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the minimum speed traveled until
you reached the downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We could have been going 25 to 30 at several times, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the crowds like in the downtown area itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. A lot of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the speed of the motorcade when you came into the
downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It would be reduced down to 10 to 15 miles an hour, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any unusual occurrences en route from Love Field
until, say, you got to the downtown area of Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we were on the outskirts of this town and apparently
reaching a crowded area there were a group of youngsters on the right side
of the car curb-line-wise, that had a large sign, oh, perhaps the width of the two
windows there, that said, "Please, Mr. President, stop and shake our hands," and
he saw this and he called to the driver and said, "Stop," he said, "call these
people over and I will shake their hands," which we did. The entire motorcade
stopped. I got out of the car and stood alongside of it while these people were
right up on me. The agents who were on the followup car, all around it. And
then after a few seconds he said, "All right; let's travel on."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say the agents in the followup car moved up at the
stopping?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Always, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Specifically, what did they do on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They crowded right in between the President, the car, and
the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the President actually leave the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long did that stop last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. A matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other unusual occurrence en route to the downtown
area itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I can recall, however, one small affair. I think we were
in the heart of Dallas on this street when a young boy jumped off the curb and
apparently he was thinking of running over to the President's car and shaking
his hands when one of our people left the followup car and put him back on the
curb, and that all happened in motion so there was nothing out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit No. 347
and ask you if you are at this time able to tell us what that photograph represents.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford, may I interrupt at this time to ask to be
excused? I have a session in the Supreme Court, but I will be back later.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>(Chief Justice Warren left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is an aerial photo of the downtown parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to identify the street on which you proceeded coming
into the area depicted by that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. This is&mdash;this would be Main Street as we came into
the heart of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I think it might be helpful if we marked that as Main Street if
we can get a pencil or pen that will mark on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. May I suggest the witness mark it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I think it is a good idea. Will you mark the street which you
have identified as Main Street?</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you also <span class="locked">mark&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We were <span class="locked">traveling&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The street onto which you turned from Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we were coming up from Main Street or down, either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what general direction were you proceeding on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This was a westerly direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you put an arrow indicating which way is north on the
map? That is a general northerly direction on the map.</p>

<p>(Witness indicating.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark an arrow on Main Street showing the direction
on which you were proceeding on Main? And how far did you proceed on Main
Street to what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Elm Street, sir. This is a very short block, maybe a couple
of hundred feet at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. My question was to what street did you proceed on Main? You
then drove to what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which way did you turn onto Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Turned right, which would be north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark the street that you have told us would be Houston
Street?</p>

<p>(Witness indicating.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far did you proceed down Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am sure it wasn't more than 200 feet at the most. It was
a real short block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What street then did you turn onto as you turned off of Houston
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. From Houston we turned onto Elm, which was a rather sharp
turn with a downgrade, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that a turn on the left or the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. To the left, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I ask that Exhibit 347 be admitted in evidence, may it please
the Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now show you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit No.
348, Mr. Kellerman, and I ask you if you are able at this time to identify what
building is in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This building right straight ahead in the photo&mdash;I couldn't
have told you on the day of the 22nd of November what it was, but as of now
this is the Texas Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the building known as the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>(The photograph marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 347 and 348 for identification
and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark on Exhibit 347&mdash;we have 348, we will get 348
back in a moment. I would like to have you mark in the aerial shot the precise
location of that building with the initials "TS."</p>

<p>(Witness marks.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For the written part of our record will you describe how many
stories high the Texas School Book Depository building is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is a seven-story building. From here it appears to be
a rather square-type constructed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. As you were proceeding in a generally northerly direction
on Houston Street, can you describe the layout of the street, indicating
first the approximate width of that street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Houston Street is a rather wide city street similar to anything
we have here in Washington, really, and being in the heart of the business
section, I would say that it was a six-lane street at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was on your right as you proceeded down Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about on your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On my left it was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you turned left onto Elm Street, will you describe what was
on your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we turned left onto Elm Street and left this building that
we are speaking of <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; then your area became clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On the right, sir. This was an open field area with a hill.
Now, there were, if I recall correctly, just at the brink of the hill, right beyond
this building in question, there was a small white&mdash;how can I describe it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A little park area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. A little park area; that is right. And beyond it it was
all open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was on your left at about that time as you proceeded
down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right. As we turned left on Elm Street off Houston, this,
too, was a little plaza area, and kind of a triangular thing where the street was
on the opposite side; this is an apparently one-way street, and directly to our
left as we turned you had to view, this looked like a little one-story plaza building
or structure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To complete the scene, as you looked ahead of you down Elm
Street what, if anything, did you see immediately in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes. First thing that I saw was that the road was going
to turn, and then a little further ahead we had a viaduct which we were going
under.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what name the Dallas Texans give to that viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I really don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you heard it described since as the triple overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the approximate width of Elm Street in lanes of
travel, if you recall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is at least three lanes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And describe the terrain, whether it was smooth, level or in
what way you went as you went down Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we went down Elm Street, there was a smooth road and
the terrain on each side was a grassy plotted area, a very cleared-off area,
visibility tremendous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And describe the composure of the crowds at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we turned north on to Houston Street, this was primarily
the end of the crowd in Dallas, Tex.; in the downtown section, there were still
a few on the sidewalk until we got to Elm Street. As we turned in a northerly
direction to Elm Street, which would be on our left, then the crowds just
diminished. They were spotty, standing on the grassy plot. They were not on
the side of the street. In fact, there were just a matter of a handful, that was
all, and we were through it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what time it was when you got to the intersection
of Houston and Elm on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not at Houston and Elm; no. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the speed of the motorcade, Mr. Kellerman, as you
were proceeding down Main Street at about the time you turned right onto
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Ten, fifteen, no more; real parade speed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far ahead of you was the lead car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Again, it was four or five car lengths in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how far behind you the President's followup car
was as you turned right onto Houston from Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I don't, but I am positive it was right on our rear
wheels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, as you turned left off Houston onto Elm, what is your best estimate of
the speed of the President's automobile at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we turned onto Elm Street and the crowd, we were
through the section of Dallas; we might have had&mdash;the driver picked it up
because we were all through. Purely a guess, we could have been going at
the most 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would your estimate, your minimum estimate, of the speed
be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Fifteen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you turned left onto Elm Street, how far were you behind
the lead car at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am going to say the same; three to five car lengths, but
I can, to go a little further, I can see this car ahead of me. He is not running
away from us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the pilot car; was that car in sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; that I didn't see; I didn't see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know from your personal observation at the time you
turned left onto Elm Street how far the President's followup car was behind
you at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not from personal observation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now, describe what occurred as you proceeded down
Elm Street after turning off of Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we turned off Houston onto Elm and made the short
little dip to the left going down grade, as I said, we were away from buildings,
and were&mdash;there was a sign on the side of the road which I don't recall what it
was or what it said, but we no more than passed that and you are out in the
open, and there is a report like a firecracker, pop. And I turned my head to
the right because whatever this noise was I was sure that it came from the
right and perhaps into the rear, and as I turned my head to the right to view
whatever it was or see whatever it was, I heard a voice from the back seat and
I firmly believe it was the President's, "My God, I am hit," and I turned around
and he has got his hands up here like this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating right hand up toward his neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right, sir. In fact, both hands were up in that
direction.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Which side of his neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Beg pardon?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Which side of his neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Both hands were up, sir; this one is like this here and
here we are with the <span class="locked">hands&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the left hand is up above the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In the collar section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you are positioning yourself in the witness chair, your right
hand is up with the finger at the ear level as if clutching from the right of the
head; would that be an accurate description of the position you pictured there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes. Good. There was enough for me to verify that the
man was hit. So, in the same motion I come right back and grabbed the speaker
and said to the driver, "Let's get out of here; we are hit," and grabbed the mike
and I said, "Lawson, this is Kellerman,"&mdash;this is Lawson, who is in the front car.
"We are hit; get us to the hospital immediately." Now, in the seconds that
I talked just now, a flurry of shells come into the car. I then looked back
and this time Mr. Hill, who was riding on the left front bumper of our followup
car, was on the back trunk of that car; the President was sideways down
into the back seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating on his left side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right; just like I am here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean, correct, left side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Correct; yes, sir. Governor Connally by that time is lying
flat backwards into her lap&mdash;Mrs. Connally&mdash;and she was lying flat over him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was lying flat over him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mrs. Connally was lying flat over the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say that you turned to your right immediately after you
heard a shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the reason for your reacting to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That was the direction that I heard this noise, pop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have a reaction as to the height from which the noise
came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; honestly, I do not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was there any reaction that you noticed on the part
of Greer when the noise was noticed by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. You are referring, Mr. Congressman, to the reaction to
get this car out of there?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Congressman, I have driven that car many times, and
I never cease to be amazed even to this day with the weight of the automobile
plus the power that is under the hood; we just literally jumped out of the
God-damn road.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As soon as this noise was heard, or as soon as you
transmitted this message to Lawson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As soon as I transmitted to the driver first as I went to
Lawson. I just leaned sideways to him and said, "Let's get out of here. We
are hit."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That comment was made to Greer; not to Lawson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And the subsequent message was to Lawson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Correct. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With relationship to that first noise that you have described,
when did you hear the voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. His voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We will start with his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. OK. From the noise of which I was in the process of turning
to determine where it was or what it was, it carried on right then. Why I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
am so positive, gentlemen, that it was his voice&mdash;there is only one man in that
back seat that was from Boston, and the accents carried very clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, had you become familiar with the President's voice prior
to that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the basis for your becoming familiar with his
voice prior to that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I had been with him for 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And had you talked with him on a very frequent basis during
the course of that association?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. He was a very free man to talk to; yes. He knew most
all the men, most everybody who worked in the White House as well as everywhere,
and he would call you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And from your experience would you say that you could recognize
the voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much, sir; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, I think you may have answered this, but I want to pinpoint
just when you heard that statement which you have attributed to President
Kennedy in relationship to the sound which you described as a firecracker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This noise which I attribute as a firecracker, when this occurred
and I am in the process of determining where it comes because I am
sure it came off my right rear somewhere; the voice broke in right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct, sir. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did President Kennedy say anything beside, "My God, I
am hit."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is the last words he said, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mrs. Kennedy say anything at that specific time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Specter, there was an awful lot of confusion in that
back seat. She did a lot of talking which I can't recall all the phrases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, <span class="locked">pinpoint&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. But after the flurry of shots, I recall her saying, "What
are they doing to you?" Now again, of course, my comparison of the voice of
her speech&mdash;certainly, I have heard it many times, and in the car there was
conversation she was carrying on through shock, I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, going back to the precise time that you heard the President
say, "My God, I am hit," do you recollect whether she said anything at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whether or not you can re-create what she said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not that I can recall right then, sir. This statement, or
whatever she said, happened after all the shooting was over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now, you have described hearing a noise which
sounded like a firecracker and you have described turning to your right and
described hearing the President's voice and, again, what was your next motion,
if any, or movement, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. After I was sure that his statement was right that he was
hit, turned from the back I come right <span class="locked">down&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You just indicated that you had turned to the left. Had you
turned to the left after hearing his voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you see? You have described what you saw in
terms of position of his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is when I completely turned to my right and grabbed
for the mike in the same motion, sideways telling the driver, "Let's get out of
here; we are hit."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you give us the best estimate of the lapse of time from
the instant you heard the sound which appeared to you to be a firecracker until
you instructed Mr. Greer in the way you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Seconds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many seconds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Three or four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, how long did it take you to relay the instructions which
you have told us about to Special Agent Lawson; what your best estimate
would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Instant, in seconds again. Again it is three to five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, in your prior testimony you described a flurry of shells
into the car. How many shots did you hear after the first noise which you
described as sounding like a firecracker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Specter, these shells came in all together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to say how many you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am going to say two, and it was like a double bang&mdash;bang,
bang.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean now two shots in addition to the first noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; yes, sir; at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the time, in seconds, from the
first noise sounding like a firecracker until the second noise which you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This was instantaneous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; let me repeat the question so I am sure you understand it.
From the time you first heard the noise coming to your right rear, which you
described as sounding like a firecracker, until you heard the flurry of shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is about how long it took, sir. As I am viewing, trying
to determine this noise, I turned to my right and I heard the voice and I came
back and I verify it and speak to the driver, grab the mike, these shots come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, you have described it as 3 to 4 seconds from the
<span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the time of the first noise&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;until you gave
the instruction to Mr. Greer and then as you made the statement to Special
Agent Lawson over the microphone that was an instantaneous timespan as you
have described it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How soon thereafter did the flurry of shots come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They came in, Mr. Specter, while I am delivering that radio
message.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To Mr. Lawson. All right. Was there any timespan which
you could discern between the first and second shots and what you have described
as the flurry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I will estimate 5 seconds, if that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But this flurry took place while you were occupied
with these other activities; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You don't recall precisely a second shot and a third
shot such as you did in the case of the first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Let me give you an illustration, sir, before I can give you an
answer. You have heard the sound barrier, of a plane breaking the sound
barrier, bang, bang? That is it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is for the second and the third, or the flurry as you
described it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; that is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On your 5-second estimate, was that in reference, Mr. Kellerman,
to the total timespan from the first noise until the flurry ended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now, when the flurry occurred then, were you still
facing forward talking into the microphone to Lawson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Then precisely what was your next movement after
completing the delivery of that message to Lawson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. When I completed the delivery of those instructions to Lawson,
I just hung up the receiver and looked back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To your right this time&mdash;to your left; pardon me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. To my left; that is right. This is when I first viewed Mr.
Hill, who was on the back of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Precisely where was he in that instant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Lying right across the trunk of the car with Mrs. Kennedy
on the left rear. Mr. Hill's head was right up in back of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you describe the left rear you mean as the car was facing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As the car is traveling, sir; yes, sir. He was lying across the
trunk of this car, feet on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he flat across the trunk of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Flat; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the position of Mrs. Kennedy's body at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. She was sitting up in the corner of this back seat, like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that she was on the buttocks area of her body at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what movement, if any, did you observe Mrs. Kennedy make
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I never did see Mrs. Kennedy leave that back seat, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say the back seat, are you <span class="locked">referring&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The seat she was sitting on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you referring to the seat itself of the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you look next; what did you observe following that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Then I observed how the President was lying, which was&mdash;he
was&mdash;flat in the seat in this direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On his left-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. Governor Connally was lying straight on his back
with Mrs. Connally over him about halfway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Governor Connally say anything up to this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mrs. Connally say anything up to that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was it that Mrs. Kennedy made the statement which you
have described, "My God, what are they doing?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This occurred after the flurry of shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At that time you looked back and saw Special Agent Hill across
the trunk of the car, had your automobile accelerated by that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Tremendously so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, to the best of your ability to recollect, exactly when did
your automobile first accelerate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Our car accelerated immediately on the time&mdash;at the
time&mdash;this flurry of shots came into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you say the <span class="locked">acceleration&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Between the second and third shot.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Might I ask a question there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. A few minutes ago you said in response to a question that
when you spoke to the driver the car leaped forward from an acceleration
immediately. Did that acceleration occur before the second shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. Just about the time that it came in.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. About the time it came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Not before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. One other question: You said the flurry of shots came in the
car. You were leaning forward talking to the driver after the first shot. What
made you aware of a flurry of shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Senator, between all the matter that was&mdash;between all the
matter that was blown off from an injured person, this stuff all came over.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Body matter; flesh.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When you were speaking of a flurry of shots, was there a
longer interval between the first shot and the second shot as compared to the
interval between the second shot and the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you first notice the substance which you have described
as body matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. When I got to the hospital, sir, it was all over my coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice it flying past you at any time prior to your
arrival at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; I know there was something in the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, in relation to the shots, Mr. Kellerman, did you notice
the substance in the air?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Fine. When I have given the orders to Mr. Lawson, this
is when it all came between the driver and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe what it was in a little more detail as it
appeared to you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is a rather poor comparison, but let's say you take a
little handful of matter&mdash;I am going to use sawdust for want of a better item&mdash;and
just throw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe the sound of the flurry of shots by way of
distinction with the way you have described the sound of the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Well, having heard all types of guns fired, most of them,
rather, if I recall correctly these were two sharp reports, sir. Again, I am
going to refer to it as like a plane going through a sound barrier; bang, bang.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you are referring to the flurry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did it sound differently from the first noise you have described
as being a firecracker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; definitely; very much so.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was there any other noise going on at the time of the
second and third shots different from the noise of the crowd or otherwise at
the time of the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We had no crowd, sir. There was nothing there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So the external noise was identical as far as <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. First or second or the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. We are in an open-field area, so to speak, and
everything was just clear.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So there was no other sound that would have disturbed
your hearing capability from the first through the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; no other shot.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Your only problem would be your personal activity
after the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Your activity of speaking to Greer and talking to
Lawson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct, sir; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was there any crowd reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There was no crowd.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There were a few stragglers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. A handful, and I didn't view any reaction, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, you said earlier that there were at least two
additional shots. Is there any area in your mind or possibility, as you recollect
that situation, that there could have been more than two shots, or are you able
to say with any certainty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am going to say that I have, from the firecracker report
and the two other shots that I know, those were three shots. But, Mr. Specter,
if President Kennedy had from all reports four wounds, Governor Connally
three, there have got to be more than three shots, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What is that answer? What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you repeat that, Mr. Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. President Kennedy had four wounds, two in the head and
shoulder and the neck. Governor Connally, from our reports, had three. There
have got to be more than three shots.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is that why you have
<span class="locked">described&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The flurry.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The noise as a flurry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Excuse me, do you have any independent recollection, Mr. Kellerman,
of the number of shots, aside from the inference that you make as to how
many points of wounds there were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Could you rephrase that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. You have drawn a conclusion, in effect, by saying that
there were four wounds for the President and three wounds for the Governor;
and from that, you say there must have been more than three shots in your
opinion or your view. But my question is: Do you have any current recollection
of having heard more than three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No. I don't. I will have to say "No."</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Has that been your recollection from the very time of the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir; it has been my opinion.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Not your opinion, but from the time of the shooting you
think then that you heard only three shots, or did <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Or did you ever think that you heard more than three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir; I can't say that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you referred to four wounds, Mr. Kellerman, realizing, of
course, your characterization is only lay opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you tell us which wounds you made reference to by that
statement, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. All right. Can I keep the train going from the time we
got to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir; do it in your own way just as you please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Fine. As we arrived at the hospital I immediately got out
of the car. Our followup car is in back of us, as you will recall. I yelled to
the agents, "Get in"&mdash;"Go get us two stretchers on wheels."</p>

<p>In the meantime in a matter of seconds&mdash;I don't know how they got out so
fast&mdash;I turned right around to the back door and opened it. By this time Mrs.
Connally had raised up, and the Governor is lying in her lap, face up. His eyes
are open and he is looking at me, and I am fairly sure he is alive. By this
time I noticed the two stretchers coming out of the emergency room, and I said
to the Governor, I said, "Governor, don't worry; everything is going to be all
right." And he nodded his head, which I was fairly convinced that that man
was alive.</p>

<p>By this time the stretcher is there. I get inside on one side of him, and
Special Agent Hill on the other. Somebody is holding his feet, and we remove
the Governor and put him on the stretcher and they take him in.</p>

<p>We then get in and help Mrs. Connally out. Our next move is to get Mrs.
Kennedy off from the seat, which was a little difficult, but she was removed.
Then Mr. Hill removed his coat and laid it over the President's face and
shoulder. He and I among two other people&mdash;I don't know&mdash;we lifted up the
President and put him on a stretcher and followed him right into the emergency
room.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, this emergency room is a, it looks like a, checkerboard; it has a
walkway down the center and a crossway and there are rooms on each side.
President Kennedy was put into the one on the right, Governor Connally across
on the left. And as we pushed the wheelchair in&mdash;we pushed the stretcher
inside, the medical people just seemed to form right in, right there, and I
walked around him and I wanted to look at this man's face, they had him face
up.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The President; I am sorry. I did not see any wounds in
that man's face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating with your hand at that moment the front part of
his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May I interrupt you just to ask whether you had any <span class="locked">view&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of the rear part of his head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the rearmost or uppermost portion of President Kennedy's
head which you could observe at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It was the hairline to the ear, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Having all the medical people in there, my business is left
in their hands. So I left. Mrs. Kennedy, incidentally, was still in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In where, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In the emergency room with him. Which after a few
minutes they convinced her to leave, and she sat outside the room while they
were working over the President. I walked into this center area of this
emergency room&mdash;and I am looking for a telephone&mdash;which there is a little doctor's
office and I walked inside, and I am alone at that time, except one medic
who was in there. There are two phones and I said, "Can I use either one of
these phones to get outside?" and he said, "Yes; just pick one up."</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Lawson enters and also Mr. Hill. I asked Mr. Lawson for
the telephone number of the Dallas White House switchboard. He immediately
has it and I said to Mr. Hill, "Will you dial it, please?" By that time a medic
comes into the room from President Kennedy's section and he asks if anybody
knows the blood type of the President&mdash;President Kennedy. We all carry it.
I produce mine, and that is what I believe they used; I am not sure. By this
time the connection is made with the White House operator in Dallas, and I
took the phone, identified myself, and I said, "Give me Washington. Please
don't pull this line; let's leave it open."</p>

<p>I got the Washington operator and I said, identified myself, and I said, "Give
me Mr. Behn."</p>

<p>Mr. Behn was in the office at the time, and I said&mdash;his name is Gerald
Behn&mdash;and I said, "Gerry, we have had an incident here in Dallas. The President,
the Governor have been shot. We are in the emergency room of the
Parkland Memorial Hospital." I said, "Mark down the time." Of course, since
that time until now we have disagreed on about 3 minutes. I said it is 12:38,
which would be 1:38 Dallas time. I am sorry&mdash;Washington time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that at the time you were talking to Mr. Behn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. To Mr. Behn; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And your version is that it is 12:38 Dallas time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. 12:38. He said it was 12:41; he told me the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May I interrupt you there for you to tell us how long after you
arrived at the hospital did you make that telephone call to Mr. Behn, to the
best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Three to five minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. The topic we are on now, Mr. Kellerman, is your
own way of relating the description of the wounds, starting with four wounds
on President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right; OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Proceed, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I can eclipse an awful lot here and get into the morgue here
in Bethesda, because that is where I looked him over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will come back and pick up some of the other detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But for the sequence at the moment, as it relates to your conclusions
on the shots which you have already testified <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I would like to develop your understanding and your observations
of the four wounds on President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. OK. This all transpired in the morgue of the Naval Hospital
in Bethesda, sir. He had a large wound this size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating a circle with your finger of the diameter of 5 inches;
would that be approximately correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, circular; yes, on this part of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the rear portion of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. More to the right side of the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right. This was removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say, "This was removed," what do you mean by this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The skull part was removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Above the ear and back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. To the left of the ear, sir, and a little high; yes. About right
in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "removed," by that do you mean that it was
absent when you saw him, or taken off by the doctor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It was absent when I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Entry into this man's head was right below that wound,
right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the bottom of the hairline immediately to the right
of the ear about the lower third of the ear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right. But it was in the hairline, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In his hairline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Near the end of his hairline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the size of that aperture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The little finger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the diameter of the little finger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what was the position of that opening with respect to the
portion of the skull which you have described as being removed or absent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Well, I am going to have to describe it similar to this. Let's
say part of your skull is removed here; this is below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have described a distance of approximately an inch and a
half, 2 inches, below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct; about that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. What other wounds, if any, did you notice on the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The other wound that I noticed was on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was it&mdash;what was its general position with respect to the
breadth of the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right straight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No. Upper shoulder, lower shoulder; how far below the lower
neckline would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The upper neckline, sir, in that large muscle between the
shoulder and the neck, just below it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the size of that opening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Again about the size of a little finger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you described three wounds which you have observed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is three. The fourth one I will have to collaborate
with&mdash;the medical people in Dallas said that he had entry in the throat or an
exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you are indicating a part on the throat right underneath
your tie as you sit there, the knot of your tie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This comes from a report from Dr. Kemp Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to Dr. Clark personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did not. This is a written report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This is a written report which you have read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any knowledge of that wound on the front side aside
from the written report of Dr. Kemp Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Except that in the morgue it was very visible that they had
incisioned him here to insert the tracheotomy that they performed on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So with the operative procedures to perform a tracheotomy, was
there anything, in your view, left of the original entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Entry or exit that you have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All you could see at that point was the operative procedure, the
cutting of the surgeon's blade in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You are saying this, then, that you did not see, yourself,
at any time the mark of any wound in his neck front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. When we took him into the hospital in Dallas; that is
right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; when we took him in the hospital in Dallas,
I did not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you ever see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Only after he was opened up in the morgue; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You saw some indication or some mark of a wound in the
front of his neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Senator, from the report of the doctor who worked on him
in Dallas, that he enlarged the incision here in his throat to perform that
tracheotomy, and I believe in his own statement that that wound was there
prior to this incision.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I know, but I am <span class="locked">asking&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I didn't see it, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What you saw yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was that because Hill had thrown his coat over the
President, or just didn't see the skin or the body at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir. When I&mdash;that coat was thrown over, sir, to eliminate
any gruesome pictures.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How far over that body? Did it go over the head
only or down the chest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; the whole coat went all the way down to the waistline,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You saw the President's face, though, at a later time as you
have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, thank you. This I had lost track of, to help you out,
Mr. Congressman. While he lay on the stretcher in that emergency room his
collar and everything is up and I saw nothing in his face to indicate an injury,
whether the shot had come through or not. He was clear.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But while he was on the stretcher in the emergency room
you saw his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But he had his tie and his collar <span class="locked">still&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Still on.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Still on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You never saw his neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. At that time, I did not observe him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The only time you saw him was later at the morgue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any blood on the portion of his body in the
neck area or anyplace in the front of his body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't recall any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any hole in the clothing of the President on
the front part, in the shirt or tie area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From your observation of the wound which you observed in
the morgue which you have described as a tracheotomy, would that have been
above or below the shirtline when the President was clothed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It would have been below the shirtline, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you described all of the wounds of the President to
which you have referred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe the three wounds which I believe you said
Governor Connally sustained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am going to refer to the medical report on Governor Connally,
wherein they said one wound was in his right <span class="locked">back&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the upper shoulder area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. One went through his wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the right wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am using the numbers, and he was&mdash;a missile went into
his thigh somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anything about Governor Connally's wounds aside
from what you read in the medical report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; not personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any independent knowledge of which wrist and
which thigh, aside from what you read in the medical reports themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; I do, I talked to the Governor several times later,
and it is the right wrist, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It is the right wrist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And which thigh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It would be the left one.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is this a good point for a recess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This is fine.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. We will take a 5-minute break.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The Commission will resume, and will you proceed, Mr.
Specter, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes sir. One of your last answers was that the position of the
wounds on Governor Connally was ascertained from a conversation between you
and Governor Connally, as well as from the medical reports themselves. Is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; it is really not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then tell us what your basis is for your testimony on Governor
Connally's wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I have never conversed with the Governor as to his other
wounds outside of his wrist. Your medical report on Governor Connally which
indicate the shoulder wound, wrist, and in the thigh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you have occasion to talk to him about his wrist
wound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Over the holidays in Texas, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The Christmas holidays?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now told us everything you know, either from conversations
or reports, about the wounds of Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Were you able to observe at the time of the shooting
and immediately thereafter, as Governor Connally went into the hospital, any
of his specific wounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Only of the&mdash;I am presuming now of the hand because, when
he was lying, he had it across his stomach here, and it was rather bloody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was it the hand that was bloody, the stomach, or both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I would say so right now; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the stomach bloody at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add, Mr. Kellerman, on the total number
of wounds in relationship to your view that there were more than three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Well, let's consider the vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine. What about the vehicle would you consider relevant in
this regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The windshield itself, which I observed a day or two after
the funeral here, had been hit by a piece of this missile or missiles, whatever it
is, shell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While you are referring to the windshield, permit me to hand
you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 349 and ask if you can tell us
what that photograph depicts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This photograph is the windshield of the Presidential special
automobile that we used in Dallas on November 22. And it depicts a hit by
some instrument on the metal railing that covers the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what position is the hit on that metal railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Directly to the right of the mirror.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that on the top of the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is on the top of the windshield. I am sorry; this is not
the windshield itself; this is the top of the vehicle. This is the framework.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you draw a red arrow with the pen that you have to the
mark which you have just described?</p>

<p>(Mr. Kellerman marked the photograph.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, when did you first observe that indentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This was observed a day or two after the funeral, which
funeral was the 25th of November; this would be upward of the 27th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was the automobile at the time you observed that
indentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. At the White House garage, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the windshield in the automobile at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; it was in the automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe or notice that indentation in the windshield
when you were in Dallas after the shooting occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe or notice that indentation before the shooting
occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to state positively whether or not that indentation
was present before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that you observed it on the first occasion when you saw the
car in the White House garage on or about November 27; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The indentation could conceivably have been present before the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It could have; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you didn't observe it before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you not observe it in Dallas after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to examine closely the windshield
area after the assassination in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to examine closely the windshield
at any time after the assassination until you saw the car in the garage on or
about November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe for the record where that indentation occurs
or is placed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This indentation is placed on the metal-bar framework which
is across the top of the windshield. The indentation is directly to the right
of the mirror holder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that on the inside or the outside of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is on the inside of the car.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What prompted you to make that investigation on or
about November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. First, Mr. Congressman, I wanted to look this car over for&mdash;let
me go back a little bit. When this car was checked over that night for
its return to Washington, I was informed the following day of the pieces of
these missiles that were found in the front seat, and I believe aside from the
skull, that was in the rear seat, I couldn't conceive even from elevation how
this shot hit President Kennedy like it did. I wanted to view this vehicle,
whether this was a slant blow off the car, whether it hit the car first and then
hit him, or what other marks are on this vehicle, and that is what prompted
me to go around and check it over myself.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had anybody told you of this indentation prior to your
own personal investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not of the windshield; no, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You were the first one to find this indentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I believe I am the first one who noticed this thing up on
the bar.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is what I meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You are the first one to notice this particular indentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; I believe I am, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to examine the windshield or the framework
closely before the assassination, either in Dallas or in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I honestly didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chairman, I move for the admission to evidence of Exhibit
No. 349.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It will be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 349
for identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now I hand to Mr. Kellerman, through the Chairman, Commission
Exhibit No. 350, and ask you to describe what this picture represents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This picture represents the windshield of the President's
special automobile as we are looking into it. This is an outside photo. My
reason for this is that on inspection there is a&mdash;the windshield has been struck
by an instrument and it has been cracked. This crack is opposite the mirror
facing the driver would be toward the driver, to the right of the mirror, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The photograph, Exhibit 350, is from the outside of the car
front looking toward the car; correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What mark, if any, appears in the photograph on the windshield
itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There is the cracked windshield located to the right of the
mirror as you look into the automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be on the driver's side, as you previously stated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; on the driver's side of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is this picture an accurate representation of the appearance
of the windshield at some time when you observed the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This windshield I observed on this same day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On or about November 27, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does that picture accurately represent what the windshield
looked like on that day when you observed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any crack in the windshield as the President's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
automobile was being driven from the point of assassination to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe it at any time prior to the time you saw the
automobile in the White House garage on or before November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to examine closely the windshield
after the time of the shooting up until the time you saw it in the White House
garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, at the time of your examination of the windshield in the
White House garage, did you feel the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On the day that I visited the White House garage and
checked this car over for my own personal reasons, and this windshield crack
was pointed out to me, I <span class="locked">did&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say it was pointed out to you, by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There were other people in the garage, Mr. Specter, like
Mr. Kinney, I believe was there at the time, Special Agent Henry Rybka was
the other person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it sufficiently prominent without having to have it pointed
out specially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Oh, yes; very much. And I felt this windshield both
inwardly and outwardly to determine first if there was something that was
struck from the back of us or&mdash;and I was satisfied that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say struck from in back of you, do you mean on the
inside or outside of the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Inside, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Inside of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to feel the outside of the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did on that day; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you feel, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not a thing; it was real smooth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to feel the inside of the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did that feel to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. My comparison was that the broken glass, broken windshield,
there was enough little roughness in there from the cracks and split that I was
positive, or it was my belief, that whatever hit it came into the inside of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I move for the admission into evidence of Exhibit No. 350.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It will be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 350
for identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now call the attention of the Commission to Exhibit No. 351,
which is the windshield itself which, as the Commission may observe, is present
in the hearing room. Now, with reference to Exhibit No. 351, which is a
marking placed over a glass object, Mr. Kellerman, can you describe for the
Commission what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; this windshield, which has since been removed from
the vehicle, at the time I first viewed it, this area marked in here was all that
was cracked. These are later splints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before you proceed, Mr. Kellerman, do you have knowledge as
to the general removal procedure during which this windshield was taken from
the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I believe I do not. However, I believe Mr. Greer would be
able to identify it better than I, on the removal side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe the condition of the windshield in its present
state as we are viewing it here this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The windshield this morning has&mdash;has been hit by some object
with sufficient <span class="locked">force&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Perhaps we ought to start with the point of impact, Mr. Kellerman.
First, are you able to positively identify this as the windshield from
the President's automobile?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; I would say it was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is this the same windshield as depicted in Exhibits 349 and 350?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now, starting with the principal point of impact,
where does that exist on this windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The principal point of impact is located to the left of the
mirror, to the right above the driver's head, and to the right of his, I am going
to say, view line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As we view the windshield at this time, state whether or not
there are spidering lines which have emanated from that point which you
have described as the principal point of impact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The spidering lines which extend in three different directions&mdash;you
are speaking of the large ones or the others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I want to put on this record all of the spidering lines
which exist here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. OK; the spidering lines which are in this encircled area
reflect, in my opinion, that when the instrument hit this glass it shattered in
half a dozen different ways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well now, with respect to the cracks themselves, is there a
crack which goes in a generally upwardly direction slanting off in the general
direction of the driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In the center of this, the impact of the center of this scratch,
one goes directly to the top of the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On that line itself, is there a further splintering off of that line
at another point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It then continues on a small leg, a straight leg, about 3 inches
from the original direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there a change of direction at that point, or a bifurcation,
dividing it into two parts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, you have described in a generally upwardly direction of
about 3 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there not a crack which then extends all the way to the
top of the windshield moving, in the direction of the left side of the windshield
from the driver facing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right. There is a complete crack from this so-called
cutoff to the top right of the windshield right above the view line of the driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Taking that from a compass reading, would that be in a generally
northeasterly direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; northeasterly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. From a point 3 inches from the center crack,
which we described as the principal point of impact, then, does there form a
point of crack in a V-direction with the line you have already described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; there does. There is a small splint, about 2 inches,
that heads directly north off from this splinter that goes in a northeasterly
direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now, moving in a clockwise direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In a clockwise direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What crack do you observe, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I next observe on the eastward side of this center crack
a splint of about 3 inches long, which then makes a sharp veer to the southeast
to the bottom of the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, moving further in a clockwise direction, what crack do
you next observe emanating from the central point of impact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The next crack from the central point of impact extends
down about 3 inches, to the southeast, and then veers to a sharp southeast
to the bottom of the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, moving further in a clockwise direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. From this <span class="locked">point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let's continue to move from the central point of impact to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
finish up what divergent cracks there are from the central point of impact.
Is there one other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There is one other point left. This is completely in a
westerly direction about 3 inches from the center of impact, which then
veers to the northwest to the top of the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there other cracks in the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There is one other splint, which is from the southeasterly
<span class="locked">leg&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be southwesterly leg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Southwesterly leg&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;that drops to within an
inch of the bottom of the windshield, whereby another splint travels in a
northwesterly direction to about halfway of the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you described all of the visible cracks in the
windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That has completed it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you have viewed this windshield, have you looked at it
from the outside looking in or the inside looking out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I have been looking from the outside looking in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where you would have been if you had been, say, on the
front hood of the car when the windshield was in place on the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I would have been&mdash;pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the hood of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On the hood of the car this would have been facing me
as it is sitting here today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have there been any measures taken to protect the outer
edges of this windshield in its position here in the hearing room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes. A form of protective tape has been placed around
the entire windshield to protect it, to keep it intact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any differences in the cracks on the windshield today
as it sits in our hearing room from its condition when you observed it on
or about November 27, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. From the point of impact the four cracks that
looked in the four directions were the only ones on this windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any marking in color or otherwise on that piece of
the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There has been a yellow crayon marking the circumference
of these four cracks, apparently before the windshield was removed from
the automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that yellow or red?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is red.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the cracks present within the circumference of that
marking present at the time you observed the windshield on or about
November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any of the other marks present when you observed the
windshield on or about November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you at this time feel the outside of the windshield and
describe what, if anything, you feel at the point of impact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The outside markings from the point of impact, the
extended <span class="locked">lines&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman. I would like for you at this time to actually
touch the outside and tell me, first of all, if it is the same or if it differs
in any way from the sense of feel which you noted when you touched it on
or about November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As I touch the outside on the impact, it would be the
same as I noticed on the 27th of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you notice, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is a smooth surface without <span class="locked">any&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Without any&mdash;finish your answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On the inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; before. It is a smooth surface without any what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Without any crack lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That can be felt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; on the outside of the windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Feel the inside and tell us, first of all, whether it is the
same or different from the way you touched it on November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On November 27, when I felt the inside of this impact
area, I was convinced that I could&mdash;that I felt an opening in one of these
lines, which was indicative to me that the blow was struck from the inside
of the car on this windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does it feel the same to you today as it did on or about
November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As a matter of fact, it feels rather smooth today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It feels somewhat differently today than it felt before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could we ask when the red circle was placed on the
windshield, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to the shattering which existed on or about November
27, which is within the red circle, could that condition have existed on
November 22 after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Absolutely not. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the reason for your expressing your thought that
it could not have existed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This automobile is never out of sight of any agent, or
even a police officer, before it is used&mdash;used or afterward. Let me clarify
that. The agent that accompanied these cars to Dallas was with the
vehicles from the time they left Washington aboard this plane. One of
his many duties outside of keeping it, having this car run perfectly, is that
all the equipment is in perfect condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, what you are saying, then, is there had been
no crack in the windshield prior to the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. My next question is: Did you observe any crack in the windshield
after the shooting on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to look for or examine for any
crack in the windshield after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I had no occasion whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If the crack in the windshield had been as prominent as it
was on or about November 27, 1963, would you have observed it after
the shooting on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir; I don't think I would have.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is it correct then to say that you didn't find any occasion
to examine the windshield after you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right, I did not have the opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And after the President was removed from the automobile,
did you ever go back and examine the car, including the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not in Dallas; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To be absolutely certain our record is straight on this point,
when you observed this windshield on or about November 27, 1963, was the
windshield in or out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It was in the car. This was the same day they were going
to remove it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they remove it later that day, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; they did, and the mechanics were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you there at the time this was removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But the mechanics had arrived preparatory to removing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, we intended to describe the windshield in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
detail prior to your mentioning it, but to go back to your train of thought,
you had brought up the windshield in response to my question about whether
you had told us everything that you had in mind when you expressed the
view that there were more than three shots. Now, remaining on the subject
of the windshield, what fact about the windshield was important in your
mind when you expressed the view that there must have been more than three
shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I may be a little&mdash;I am not ahead of myself in your investigation
of this case, but I think with the evidence that you all have on the
numbers, on the pieces of evidence that were found in the car, plus the
fact that you have a missile that was received from Dallas, from one of
the stretchers, plus the fact of the missile that, to my knowledge, hasn't
been removed from Governor Connally&mdash;it may have, I don't know&mdash;count up
to more than three to me, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right; fine. But focusing just a moment on the windshield
in and of itself, is there any physical factor or characteristic of the
windshield other than those already described for the record which has any
bearing on your conclusion about the number of shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; it does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, moving on to the other pieces of evidence which you
have just described, you referred to pieces of evidence in the car. What
did you mean when you made that reference, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I have&mdash;I was told, although this is a hearsay <span class="locked">thing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For these purposes, please tell us whatever you are referring
to, whatever its source, hearsay or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Okay; fine. That when they examined that vehicle that
night, when it was brought back to Washington, D.C., two pieces of a bullet or
bullets were found on the passenger side on the floor of the front seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you that, or what report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Boring&mdash;Floyd Boring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who is Mr. Boring?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. He is also an assistant special agent in charge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is he currently with the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. He is currently with the Secret Service at the White House;
yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were those two pieces of bullet described with more particularity
than you have mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; they were not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were they described as fragments of bullets as distinguished
from whole bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But do you have any information as to the size of the fragments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other pieces of evidence in the car that you were
referring to there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The only other piece of evidence in the car was President
Kennedy's skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Do you know what was done with those fragments
that Mr. Boring told you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not those were turned over to the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I would say they were probably turned over to the FBI;
yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And why would you say they probably were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Because they were assigned to going over the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it their procedure to turn over whatever they found to
the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is there anything special in the nature of the skull which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
you just mentioned which would have any bearing on the number of shots fired
in this assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, but it would be one shell, one shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That would be my conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That it would take one shot to have separated that portion of
skull?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mentioned a missile found on a stretcher in Dallas. Will
you elaborate on what you were referring to there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This was given, I believe, in your statements there, to a
Special Agent Johnsen. I haven't seen this missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you referring there to the missile which was found on
the stretcher and to the sequence of events from which it was traced back to
one of the two victims of this shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any more knowledge about that other than that
which you have already mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mentioned a missile which was not removed from Governor
Connally. Specifically, what did you refer to there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There was in the early&mdash;this was on the day in Parkland
Memorial Hospital, and this information comes from Dr. George Burkley, the
President's physician, when, I believe, I asked him the condition of Governor
Connally, and have they removed the bullet from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Dr. Burkley say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Dr. Burkley said that to his knowledge he still has the
bullet in him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what time on November 22 was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This was after we got into the hospital after the shooting,
sir, between then and 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that the operation on Governor Connally had not been completed
at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any additional knowledge about any bullet in
Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now told us about all of the facts which you took
into account in your conclusion that there were more than three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add, Mr. Kellerman, by way of explanation
or elaboration, to tell us which might be helpful with respect to
your conclusion based on all of these items which you have described to us
that there were more than three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Gentlemen, I think if you would view the films yourself you
may come up with a little different answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, have you viewed the films, Mr. Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I have; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there something special in your viewing of the films which
led you to believe that there were more than three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; it doesn't point out more than three shots, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which films are you referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. These are the colored ones that were taken on the right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Taken by Mr. Abraham Zapruder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are not familiar with the photographer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, can you describe the view you say is from the right-hand
side of the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that would be on the side of the road where the Texas School
Book Depository Building was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And approximately where did those pictures begin and end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. These pictures began as we turned off Houston Street onto
Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did they end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. As we are, just before we are, going into the viaduct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were those black and white or in color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; they were colored.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you seen any other films of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; I saw a black-and-white, but I didn't&mdash;I saw a black-and-white
film. However, I didn't get enough out of it there <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before proceeding any further, I would like to move for the
introduction in evidence of Exhibit 351.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is approved.</p>

<p>(The windshield referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 351 for
identification and was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything at all to add which you think might be
helpful, Mr. Kellerman, on the question of how many shots were fired, or have
you told us everything you have in mind on that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I believe I have, Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was the name of the special agent driving the car&mdash;the
President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. William Greer.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He was the one to whom you spoke when you heard the
report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Has he ever expressed any opinion to you as to the number
of shots that were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir. I think we are all of the opinion, Senator, that we
know of three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, referring to Commission Exhibit No. 347, will
you pinpoint as precisely as you can on that aerial shot, aerial picture, where
the President's car was at the time of the first shot? And mark that, if you
would, please, with an "X" in red pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. My guess would be right in here, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you mark as closely as you can where the President's
car was at the time of the second shot and mark that with a "Y" in red.</p>

<p>(Mr. Kellerman marking the picture.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you have marked the cars being in approximately the
middle of the road; is that accurate, as you recollect it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is the general procedure, Mr. Specter; they were traveling
in the center of the road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, with respect to the time of the third shot, would your
marking be any different from the "Y" position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; it would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, from the time of the shooting until the time the automobile
arrived at Parkland Hospital, did anyone in the President's car say anything
that you have not already told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, there is a report from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation designated "Bureau File No. 105"&mdash;I believe there is an "S",
although it is somewhat illegible on my copy&mdash;"S2555, report of Special Agent
Robert P. Gemberling," dated December 10, 1963, which refers to an interview
of you by Special Agent Francis X. O'Neill, Jr., and James W. Sibert, in which
the following is set forth:</p>

<p>"He"&mdash;and this obviously refers to you&mdash;"advised that he heard a shot and
immediately turned around looking past Governor Connally who was seated
directly in back of him, to the President. He observed the President slumped
forward and heard him say 'get me to a hospital.' Mr. Kellerman then heard
Mrs. Kennedy say, 'Oh, no,' as the President leaned toward her." That is
the end of the quotation. My question is: Did you hear him; did you hear
President Kennedy say, "Get me to a hospital"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear Mrs. Kennedy say, "Oh, no"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any knowledge or explanation as to why you would
have been so quoted in the report of the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. When these two gentlemen talked to me, I don't know where
they got those quotes, because the only two things that I told them, they were
interested in what I heard from the people in the back seat, and one said "my
God, I have been hit," which was President Kennedy, and Mrs. Kennedy said,
"What are they doing to you?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were interviewed, however, by Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Sibert
on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. November what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No. November 22 is when they were in the morgue with
me. They interviewed me in the office that&mdash;it was around the 27th. This was
after the funeral.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they have any conversation with you about these events in
the morgue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have a discussion with either of those gentlemen about
anything while you were at the morgue on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The only thing I can recall discussionwise&mdash;I just forget
which one it was, one of the two&mdash;this was before we even knew that a shell had
been found from the hole in the President's shoulder. We couldn't determine
what happened to it. They couldn't find it in the morgue; they couldn't find
any leeway as to whatever happened to the shell when it hit the President's
shoulder; where did it go. So our contention was that while he was on the
stretcher in Dallas, and the neurosurgeon was working over him no doubt
with pressure on the heart, this thing worked itself out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "our contention," what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. One of these agents&mdash;I forget which one it was; it could
have been Sibert or O'Neill, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We&mdash;our discussion or my discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You had a discussion and when you say "our contention" by
that do you mean that was the conclusion you came to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Conclusion&mdash;that is right, sir&mdash;as to where this bullet went
into the shoulder and where did it go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While you are on that subject, was there any conversation at
the time of the autopsy on that matter itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate to the Commission the nature of that conversation
and the parties to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There were three gentlemen who were performing this
autopsy. A Colonel Finck&mdash;during the examination of the President, from
the hole that was in his shoulder, and with a probe, and we were standing right
alongside of him, he is probing inside the shoulder with his instrument and I
said, "Colonel, where did it go?" He said, "There are no lanes for an outlet
of this entry in this man's shoulder."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you say anything in response to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I said, "Colonel, would it have been possible that while he
was on the stretcher in Dallas that it works itself out?" And he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any additional conversation between you and Colonel
Finck at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not on that point; no, sir; not on that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any conversation of any sort between you and
Colonel Finck which would be helpful to us here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Well, from Humes, who was the other gentleman out there,
from the entry of the skull, from this hole here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are now referring to the hole which you describe being
below the missing part of the skull?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; it was confirmed that the entry of the shell here
went right through the top and removed that piece of the skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who confirmed that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. One of the three gentlemen; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You don't recall which one, but it was one of the three doctors
doing the autopsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So you are saying it confirmed that the hole that was below
the piece of skull that was removed, was the point of entry of the one bullet
which then passed up through the head and took off the skull?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right, sir. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then that was all done by one bullet, based on what you are
telling us at this moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the confirmation that one of the three doctors made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, was there any other conversation between you and Colonel
Finck or Commander <span class="locked">Humes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At that time, which was important on the subject we are
discussing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Actually, from all the X-rays that were taken, and we viewed
them all together; when I say "we," I am saying the medical people who were
in the morgue at the time, the two Bureau agents, myself, and also Mr. Greer,
who was in there with me, naturally, they were looking for pieces of fragmentation
of this bullet. There was none; only one piece to my knowledge.
That was removed inside above the eye, the right eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have now told us all about the conversations between you
and Colonel Finck and Commander Humes and anyone else at the autopsy which
are important on the positions of the hole and the wounds in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any other conversation with either Special Agent
O'Neill or Special Agent Sibert of the FBI on November 22, 1963, other than
your conversations about the wounds on President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, while we are discussing this in relationship to
your conversations with Special Agents O'Neill and Sibert, were there any other
comments made by anybody else present at the autopsy about the path of the
bullet into Mr. Kennedy's back, relating to whether there was any point of exit
or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Colonel Finck did all the talking, sir. He was the only
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you told us everything Colonel Finck said about that
subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that there is nothing that was said on that subject other
than what you have already told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, I have read to you a part of what Special
Agents O'Neill and Sibert have attributed to you in an interview which they
have written about on November 22, 1963. Referring to that in the portion
which I have read to you and which I will reread, I want you to direct your
attention to the issue about which way you turned. The report states, "He
advised he heard a shot and immediately turned around looking past Governor
Connally who was seated directly in back of him to the President."</p>

<p>Now, did that describe a turn to the right or to the left? This is a difficult
question. Let me interject one thing. We are presupposing here, based on your
testimony, that you did not discuss with Special Agents O'Neill or Sibert these
specific events on November 22, to the best of your recollection as we sit here
today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that the question really goes to a situation where perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
they have an inaccurate day or your recollection is inaccurate as to some of the
things you might have told them. So, my prefatory question would be whether
that is an accurate statement and is something you told them at some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't believe I did. I think I will stand on my original
statement.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The original statement you made here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that the statement I just read to you, so far as your <span class="locked">best&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I <span class="locked">can't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So far as your best testimony is at this time, it was simply not
made by you on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, now. Was that statement I just read to you, the
short one about your turn, to the best of your recollection at this moment, did
you ever make that statement to Special Agents O'Neill and/or Sibert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Specter, everybody I have talked to I have always turned
to the right when I first heard the noise. I turned to my left to view the
people in my back seat because it is a more comfortable position. So I don't
think the turning is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you say the report is incorrect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask&mdash;you have viewed these colored motion
pictures which were taken during the assassination. Have you looked at those
to see what your own actions were during this period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do they coincide with what you have testified to here
today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They certainly do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit
No. 352, and ask you if you can tell us what that picture represents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; this was the rear seat of the President's car, sir,
after all the occupants were removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did the rear seat of the President's car look like the
picture 352?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. After all the occupants were removed on the 22d of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When the car was parked at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't know where this picture was taken, sir. This could
have been taken in the White House garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; but aside from where the picture was taken, is that the
way the car looked at the time it was at Parkland Hospital after President
Kennedy and Governor Connally were removed from the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe for the written record very briefly what this
picture shows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The picture shows the complete rear seat of the Presidential
limousine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, is on the rear seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. On the seat part of this car is splattered with blood; there
are a few petals of flowers, and the back seat cushion part is pretty well
bloodied up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I move for the introduction in evidence of Commission Exhibit
No. 352.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 352 for
identification, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now hand you, through the Chairman, Commission Exhibit
No. 353, move its admission into evidence, and ask you to tell us what this depicts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This is the same Presidential vehicle after the occupants
have been removed from the rear seat. It shows the&mdash;a goodly amount of blood
that had remained on the cushion and back part of the seat and also little flower
petals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is Exhibit No. 353 an accurate representation of the way the
rear seat of the President's automobile looked <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After President Kennedy and Governor Connally were removed
to Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have described in answers to previous questions what occurred
upon the arrival at Parkland of the President's automobile. What action,
if any, did you take immediately after President Kennedy and Governor
Connally were taken into the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I believe we had got to the point where I had made this
phone call to Washington to alert these people back here of the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And proceeding from that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. From this point, the agents who were in this followup car
had joined me in the emergency room. They took up security posts at entrance
into the emergency room to keep it clear of all people except medical people.
The only people allowed in there would be workers. After this was done, Special
Agent Kinney came to me and asked permission to remove the President's
car and our followup car to the airport, to load it aboard this aircraft for shipment
to Washington, and I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>At that time the next move was Special Agent Warren Taylor, who was assigned
to the then Vice President Johnson, came to me and he said, "Mr. Johnson
wants to talk to you." So, I followed him into this room that they had the
Johnson party in. He asked me the condition of President Kennedy, which I
told him that President Kennedy is still in the emergency room, his condition is
serious. He then said, "You let me know of any developments."</p>

<p>I then returned to the emergency room. By that time another shift of agents,
who were at the Trade Mart on duty for prior to our arrival, reported into the
emergency room. This is what is called as our afternoon shift, the 4 to 12.
Mr. Roberts, whose group was on the followup car in the motorcade through
Dallas, was the 8-to-4 shift. The 4-to-12 shift then was under the supervision
of Mr. Stewart Stout. I then instructed Mr. Roberts to take his shift, which
were the day people, and join Special Agent Rufus Youngblood and stay with
Vice President Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many agents were they to take with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They took the entire followup car, which would mean that
they had Roberts, Ready, Bennett, McIntyre; those four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know where they went or what specifically they did by
way of establishing security for Vice President Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I really don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your next activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. My next move, then, my next part in this was&mdash;by this time
it was after 1 o'clock&mdash;I am trying to pinpoint time&mdash;after 1, because Dr. Burkley
said that the President had died; it was after 1 o'clock. By this time other
people who were in with Mr. Kennedy, such as his staff&mdash;I am speaking of Mr.
O'Donnell, Mr. Powers, I believe Larry O'Brien&mdash;through them, and I believe
Mr. Hill, they had obtained a casket from one of the funeral people in town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where had Mrs. Kennedy been during this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mrs. Kennedy was right outside the door to the emergency
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long, if at all, was she inside the emergency room with
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This I can't truly answer. However, I should say that, as
for the casket being brought into the hospital, another gentleman came into this
little doctor's room, his name I don't recall, but he represented himself to be
from the Health Department or commission, some form. He said to me, he
said, "There has been a homicide here, you won't be able to remove the body.
We will have to take it down there to the mortuary and have an autopsy." I
said, "No, we are not." And he said, "We have a law here whereby you have to
comply with it."</p>

<p>With that Dr. Burkley walked in, and I said, "Doctor, this man is from some
health unit in town. He tells me we can't remove this body." The Doctor became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
a little enraged; he said, "We are removing it." He said, "This is the
President of the United States and there should be some consideration in an
event like this." And I told this gentleman, I said, "You are going to have to
come up with something a little stronger than you to give me the law that this
body can't be removed."</p>

<p>So, he frantically called everybody he could think of and he hasn't got an
answer; nobody is home. Shortly he leaves this little room and it seems like a
few minutes he is back and he has another gentleman with him, and he said,
"This is"&mdash;the name escapes me&mdash;he said, "He is a judge here in Dallas," and
he said, "He will tell you whether you can remove this body or not." I said, "It
doesn't make any difference. We are going to move it," and I said, "Judge, do
you know who I am?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Yes," and I said, "There must be something in your thinking
here that we don't have to go through this agony; the family doesn't have to
go through this. We will take care of the matter when we get back to Washington."
The poor man looked at me and he said, "I know who you are,"
and he said, "I can't help you out." I said, "All right, sir." But then I
happened to look to the right and I can see the casket coming on rollers, and
I just left the room and let it out through the emergency entrance and we
got to the ambulance and put it in, shut the door after Mrs. Kennedy and General
McHugh and Clinton Hill in the rear part of this ambulance.</p>

<p>I am looking around for Mr. Greer and I don't spot him directly because I
want to get out of here in a hurry, and I recognize Agent Berger and I said,
"Berger, you get in the front seat and drive and, Mr. Stout, you get in the
middle and I will set on this side," and as we are leaving&mdash;Mr. Lawson, I should
say, was in a police car that led us away from Parkland Memorial Hospital.
As we are leaving a gentleman taps on the driver's window and they roll it
down and he says, "I will meet you at the mortuary." "Yes, sir." We went
to the airport, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who said, "Yes, sir"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I did, sir. We went to the airport. In the meantime,
Mr. Johnson had been taken to the airplane. They had secured the airport;
nobody was there. They had removed seats off the rear part of the plane so
we could put the body and the casket in it. As we got to the airport the ramp
was there; we opened the door, and we moved the casket out and walked it
right up to the plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any further difficulty of any <span class="locked">sort&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Imposed by any Texas officials on the removal of the body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir. Whatever happened to the hearse, I don't know.
I never left the plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you <span class="locked">observe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We left the hospital; we have a time on that; it is 4 minutes
after 2. It is about a 10-minute ride to the airplane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the question of timing, pinning down these times as best
we can, how long did it take you to get from the shooting incident to the time
you arrived at Parkland, based on your best estimates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Specter, it seemed like hours, but we flew there, I
honestly don't know. I can't really tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the best estimate of the speed of your vehicle en route
from the shooting to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Let the record show that Congressman Ford has to go to
his official duties in the House and that I, Senator Cooper, am now acting as
Chairman.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Moving ahead, then, on to the sequences of time as best you
can recollect them, Mr. Kellerman, at what time was it ascertained that the
President had died and what was the basis of the pronouncement of death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That was on the death certificate, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you learn at or about 1 o'clock, while you were at Parkland
Hospital, that he had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I would think so. However, at that time let me say that I
wasn't watching any clock too closely and this time was given to me by Dr.
Burkley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then you have no independent recollection of time at Parkland
when the death was announced or pronounced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, then, you have specified the time of departure from
Parkland Hospital and en route back to Love Field at what, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We departed at 4 minutes after 2 from Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive at the President's plane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. 2:14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your next activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Our next time, we had waited until Judge Sarah Hughes
had arrived for the swearing-in ceremonies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did the swearing-in ceremonies occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. 2:37 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what time did the plane depart from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We left at 2:48.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present during the swearing-in ceremonies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In a general way, tell us who else was present there, recognizing
that you don't know all the people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes. President Johnson, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Kennedy,
Malcolm Kilduff. He was the press secretary for that trip. Congressman
Thornberry, Congressman Thomas, Marie Fehmer, Mrs. Evelyn Lincoln, Jack
Valenti, Bill Moyers, Special Agent Johns. There was another congressional
man&mdash;I believe his name was Congressman Roberts&mdash;Brooks; I am sorry;
Congressman Brooks. The picture was taken by Capt. Cecil Stoughton and
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did the President's plane arrive back at the Washington
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. May I look at my notes, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, you may. Identify for us, if you will, what notes you are
referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. 5:58 p.m. This is my report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Kellerman has just referred to a
four-page report dated November 29, 1963, entitled "The Assassination of President
John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, at Dallas, Tex.," which is a copy
of a report he made, three of the sheets being carbon copies, and one being a
photostatic reproduction. So that our record may be complete, let the record
show that this is the same report which Mr. Kellerman submitted to the Secret
Service which was, in turn, submitted by the Secret Service to the Commission, as
one of the statements in Exhibit 12, statement 11, which was furnished by the
Secret Service to the Commission as the report of the U.S. Secret Service on the
assassination of President Kennedy, under the exhibits section. I will return
that to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Fine; thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your activities; specifically where did you land in the
Washington area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We landed at Andrews Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your activities then, immediately after landing at
Andrews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. While en route from Dallas to Washington, D.C., I had
several telephone communications with my special agent in charge, Gerald Behn,
concerning this, transportation for the people aboard the plane, an ambulance
for the body of President Kennedy, and my instructions. I was instructed to
stay with the late President Kennedy. Aboard this plane were agents of the
4-to-12 shift which, as I mentioned earlier, was under the supervision of Mr.
Stewart Stout; a conference was held with Mr. Rufus Youngblood, who was in
charge of the Johnson detail at that time. He was informed that he would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
all the agents under Mr. Stout's supervision and they would remain with them
for the remainder of the day. That I would have Special Agents Hill, Landis,
Greer, and O'Leary.</p>

<p>As we arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, arrangements were made prior to
having a lift brought up to the rear end of the plane, whereby all the agents were
requested by Mrs. Kennedy to carry this casket from the plane to the ambulance.
It was put aboard this carrier; from there we took it from the carrier into the
Navy ambulance. Mrs. Kennedy rode in the back seat, or in the rear part of the
ambulance, with Mr. Robert Kennedy and General McHugh.</p>

<p>In the front seat the ambulance was driven by Special Agent Greer, of which
Agents Landis and myself and Dr. Burkley rode in the front seat to the U.S.
Naval Hospital in Bethesda. At that point Navy officials there instructed us
where to take the ambulance, to what part of the building, and remove the casket
into the morgue facilities.</p>

<p>As we landed in Andrews Air Force Base, I was met by our Chief, Mr. James
Rowley, who informed me that Mr. Sibert and Mr. O'Neill of the FBI would
join me at the Naval Hospital and to allow them in. I also informed him that
the vehicles&mdash;that is, the President's car and our Secret Service followup car&mdash;are
en route to Washington from Dallas, and that he should assign some members
from our Washington field office to go over these cars for any evidence that might
be left. In the morgue, I should say that Special Agent Greer and myself
remained all night, Mr. O'Leary only briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The family was <span class="locked">placed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did the family go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They were placed in a room in the tower section of the Naval
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you actually accompany the body from the vehicle to the
morgue room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you present during the entire autopsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell us in a general <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I only left on three different occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For how long were you absent on those occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. A minute or two to make a phone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While the autopsy was in session, or when did you leave on those
three occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. OK. First I was informed by a Navy personnel that I should
call Mr. Rowley. There wasn't any phone&mdash;there was a phone in the room, but
I wasn't aware of it at the time. So, I left and walked out into the corridor
and called him. This was my first knowledge that they had found a projectile.
The second call, I think I called home; that was my first call to home and that
was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, the projectile that you just referred to was found where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This was the projectile that was reportedly given to our
Special Agent Richard Johnsen as we were leaving the hospital in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you find out about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. He says it was given to him by a security man or security
officer in the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you first hear about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The phone call with Mr. Rowley that morning after we had
got to the morgue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I am only guessing; 9 o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Nine o'clock in the evening. You had said morning; you didn't
mean morning; you meant 9 o'clock in the evening when you had a telephone call.
From whom was the call again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Rowley, Chief of Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You got the phone call from Mr. Rowley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who had called him, if you know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But at that time Chief Rowley advised of the detection of the
bullet on the stretcher and brought you up to date with what information was
known at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you described all the times that you were absent from
the room of the autopsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The only other time that I was absent was when the autopsy
was about completed before the funeral directors were in, and it was my decision
to get Mr. Hill down and view this man for all the damage that was done;
so I went up to the floor where they were at and brought him down and he inspected
the incisions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your reason for that, Mr. Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. More witnesses, Mr. Specter; I think more to view the unfortunate
happenings it would be a little better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did that autopsy start, as you recollect it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Immediately. Immediately after we brought him right in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time was that approximately, if you have a recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't have a recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did it end, if you recollect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. We left the hospital for the White House at 3:56 in the
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. 3:56 a.m. on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the autopsy last all that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No. They were going to give these people a couple of hours
that they worked on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you observe, during the course of the autopsy, bullet
fragments which you might describe as little stars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, of the numerous X-rays that were taken mainly of the
skull, the head. The reason for it was that through all the probing which these
gentlemen were trying to pick up little pieces of evidence in the form of shell
fragments, they were unable to locate any. From the X-rays, when you placed
the X-ray up against the light the whole head looked like a little mass of stars,
there must have been 30, 40 lights where these pieces were so minute that they
couldn't be reached. However, all through this series of X-rays this was the
one that they found, through X-ray that was above the right eye, and they
removed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How big a piece was that above the right eye, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The tip of a matchhead, a little larger.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Let me ask a few questions. Mr. Kellerman, from what you
have just said, I think it would be correct that from the time you began to
assist in removing President Kennedy from his car to the time you left him in
the emergency room that you never saw any bullet on a stretcher, either his
stretcher or Governor Connally's stretcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I never saw any bullet, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I believe you testified that, at the time you heard this first
report, the President's car was approaching a viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Approaching, yes, but quite a little distance from it, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Can you make any estimate as to how far away it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't know the footage, Senator Cooper.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Can you see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Can you see the viaduct plainly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Could you tell whether anybody was standing on top of the
viaduct, or did you observe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I didn't notice anybody up there at all, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you observe whether anyone was in the immediate vicinity
of the viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not at this distance; no.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you have any&mdash;at the time of the shots, at the time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
you were conscious of these shots being fired, do you have any judgment as to
from what direction they came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. None whatsoever. Except I should say again that when this
first one went off, which I indicated here that it sounded like a firecracker to my
right and, say, rear, I looked to my right to see what it was.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Then it would be correct to say it was your judgment at the
time, at the time of the <span class="locked">report&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It was my judgment, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That it was to the right and to the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That would be correct. It was my judgment, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you observe any persons standing to the right of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Maybe a handful.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see anything to indicate that any shot had been fired
by those persons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir; not at the time.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When you heard the report and turned, could you see this
building known as the Texas Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not by name. You could see the building because we passed
right in front of it, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You didn't know it as the Texas Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not then, no, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you any idea how&mdash;what distance the President's car
traveled from the time you heard the first report until the time you have described
as hearing the flurry of shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I really don't know the distance. It wasn't too far.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It wasn't too far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For the record, I have some more questions when we reconvene.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. We will recess then until 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller"><a name="Afternoon_Session" id="Afternoon_Session">Afternoon Session</a></span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROY H. KELLERMAN, SPECIAL AGENT, SECRET
SERVICE, RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>Will you proceed, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, thank you. Mr. Kellerman, immediately before the luncheon
recess, Senator Cooper had asked some questions relating to the presence of
anyone on the triple overpass which was in front of the President's car. Did
you have any occasion, immediately before or immediately after the shooting,
to look for anyone on the triple overpass or in that vicinity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I really didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you in a position to state, then, whether there was or was
not someone on the triple overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I am in no position to state that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the time of the shooting, did you observe any bullets ricochet
off of the windshield or off of any other part of the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No. If any of the bullets ricocheted off the windshield
or front part of the car, this would have been matter that was blown over mine
and the driver's head from, I would say, the explosion of President Kennedy's
head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But aside from the portions of President Kennedy's head which
you have already testified about, you observed nothing detectable as being
bullet fragments or bullets?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Ricocheting off any part of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you ever observe any bullet fragments in the car at
rest after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe a priest at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; there were two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And approximately what time were they present at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. When we brought President Kennedy into the emergency
room, the request for a priest was made immediately by one of the members
of the staff. I do not recall who called for one. However, in the interim, a
second call was sent out. Consequently, two showed; not at the same time,
but one after the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were they at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Just a matter of a couple of minutes of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you know where they went upon arrival at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. They went right in the emergency room with the
President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you in the emergency room at the time they were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you know what services, if any, they performed while
they were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any conversations with either of them while they
were en route, either coming or going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to the state of readiness of Parkland Hospital at
your arrival, how long after you got there were stretcher bearers at the front
door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. To the best of my knowledge, there were no stretcher bearers
at the car&mdash;none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At your arrival?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did some come shortly after you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, what sequence did follow with respect to the arrival of
the stretchers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. When we arrived at the hospital, I had called to the agents
to go inside and get two stretchers on wheels. Between those people and police
officers who also entered the emergency room, they brought the stretchers out.
I did not at any time see a man in a white uniform outside, indicating a medical
person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you first see the first indication of a doctor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. When we got in the emergency room itself proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you know which doctor that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not by name or sight; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many doctors did you see at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The room was full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who were the individuals who brought the stretchers on wheels,
if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Agents who were in the followup car, police officers who
were ahead of us on motorcycles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, did you state how long the autopsy lasted when
you testified this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; I didn't. However, this is going to be an assumption
on time; I think I can pin it pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Give us your best estimate on that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Let's come back to the period of our arrival at Andrews Air
Force Base, which was 5:58 p.m. at night. By the time it took us to take the
body from the plane into the ambulance, and a couple of carloads of staff people
who followed us, we may have spent 15 minutes there. And in driving from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Andrews to the U.S. Naval Hospital, I would judge, a good 45 minutes. So
there is 7 o'clock. We went immediately over, without too much delay on the
outside of the hospital, into the morgue. The Navy people had their staff in
readiness right then. There wasn't anybody to call. They were all there. So
at the latest, 7:30, they began to work on the autopsy. And, as I said, we left
the hospital at 3:56 in the morning. Let's give the undertaker people 2 hours.
So they were through at 2 o'clock in the morning. I would judge offhand that
they worked on the autopsy angle 4½, 5 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you present when the funeral director's personnel were
preparing the body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I was; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about what time, then, did they complete their work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They were all through at 3:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do immediately after they completed their
work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. All right. Our communication between the Kennedy family
and staff, who were on another floor in the hospital, was in this regard. We
had telephone communication whereby we would tell them if the body is ready to
be taken out of the morgue and into the ambulance. And they would hit the
elevator and come right out the same way. So the 5 minutes it took to load the
people in, we left the hospital morgue part at least at 3:50, and, as I say, we
were off at 3:56, driving to the White House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you go directly to the White House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did that complete your tour of duty for that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, with respect to the time you were present at the autopsy,
was there any conversation of any sort concerning the possibility of a point of
entry from the front of the President's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have testified about the impression you had as to the source
of the first shot, which sounded to you like a firecracker. Did you have any
impression as to the source of the other shots, which you described as being
a flurry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. If you will excuse me just a minute.   I was trying to elaborate
on the last question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Pardon me. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Just for the record, I wish to have this down. While the
President is in the morgue, he is lying flat. And with the part of the skull
removed, and the hole in the throat, nobody was aware until they lifted him up
that there was a hole in his shoulder. That was the first concrete evidence that
they knew that the man was hit in the back first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did they lift him up and first observe the hole in the
shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They had been working on him for quite some time, Mr.
Specter&mdash;through the photos and other things they do through an autopsy. And
I believe it was this Colonel Finck who raised him and there was a clean hole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was said, if anything, by those present at the autopsy
concerning the wound in the throat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. To go back just a little further, the reason for the hole in
the throat, the tracheotomy; I am thinking they were of the opinion that when
the&mdash;when he was shot in the head, and they had found this piece remaining
above the eye underneath; I am sure there was some concern as to where the
outlet was, and whether they considered&mdash;this is all an assumption now; whether
they considered this&mdash;that there was a hole here in the throat prior to the
tracheotomy, I don't know. But to complete the examination, they lifted him
up by the shoulders, and there was this hole. Now, I think you asked me a
question. Could you repeat it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, let's be sure that we have your final answer on the question
of any conversation at all about a point of entry in the front part of his
body, in his throat, or any place else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't believe, Mr. Specter, that it was ever concluded
that there was an entry in the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then that completes the conversations at the autopsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On any of the subjects I have asked you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The question which I had then started to ask you was whether
you had any impression at the time of the second and third shots, which you
described as a flurry of shots, as to the point of origin or source of those
shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The only answer I can give to that is that they would have
to come from the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, is that the impression or reaction you had at the time
of the flurry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever, since the time of the assassination to this date,
had any contrary impression, reaction, or view that the shots came from the
front of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, Mr. Kellerman, with respect to the immediate reaction
by you to the emergency situation, did you consider at any time leaving your seat,
on the right front of the President's automobile, to go into the rear portion,
where the President sat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the basis for&mdash;or what was the basis for your
conclusion on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. After I had heard President Kennedy's voice say, "My God,
I am hit," I viewed him, which was enough for me that he was. My decision
was to get this man to a hospital, because he needed medical treatment. And
during the few seconds that I instructed the driver to get out of here, we are hit,
my second instruction was to the man in the lead car ahead of us for the same,
to lead us to a hospital, that we are hit. I then turn around, and I had two
people injured. Not only was the President down in his seat; the Governor
was down in his seat. My presence back there was gone. On top of that, I
had Mr. Hill lying across that trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean when you say, sir, that your presence back
there was gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They were comfortable, if there is a comfort in this. Mr. Hill
was taking care of Mrs. Kennedy. Mrs. Connally was over the Governor; there
was no motion. The next thing was a doctor, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you consider presenting a further shield for the President
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the metallic handhold which you described early in your
testimony as being about 15 inches off the top of the seat and going all the
way across the width of the car, did that metal structure present any substantial
impediment to your moving from the front seat to the rear seat of
the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Specter, I think it would have been a small obstacle.
However, let me say this: If I thought in my own mind that I was needed back
there, there wouldn't have been an obstacle strong enough to hold me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the presence of Governor Connally in the jump
seat? Would the presence of Governor Connally or any passenger in the jump
seat provide a substantial obstacle to your moving from your seat to shield
the President's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not at all. It wouldn't have made any difference, sir.
Why? Because my job is to protect the President, sir, regardless of the
obstacles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Greer at any time use the radio in your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Kellerman, did the President's automobile at any time slow
down after the first shot?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chairman, that completes our questions, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As you turned from Houston onto Elm, you were then
facing the triple overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You were looking forward at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You were not looking to the side particularly, or back
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Don't let me change your thought, Mr. Congressman. But
as we turned left on Elm, there is also another curve before you get to this
overpass.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A rather slight curve to the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much. I still knew there was an overpass.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But your concentration was ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Ahead.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not to the side or to the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No; not to the rear especially; that is true. Let me explain
a little more. When you are riding in this automobile, which is with him, and
on your right side, naturally you are observing more on the right. It is obvious.
However, you still have time periodically to glance over to the left for viewing
anything that might be of a danger&mdash;whether it is people or any other object.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There is no way you would know from personal observation
in what direction the President was looking at the time he was hit
by the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; I would not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you outline for us here the process by which
you were put in charge of this particular operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you outline for us the procedure that is followed
in such cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, indeed. As I said earlier, we have three people, for
a better word, in charge of the White House detail. Mr. Behn&mdash;Gerald Behn&mdash;is
the special agent in charge. There are two assistants, Floyd Boring and
myself. On all trips this was a divided matter. And this one was my trip.
Not that I picked it or anything. It was my trip that Mr. Behn said, "You will
make this one with the President." The other two people would have other
duties to do. And this is how it fell on to me for that day, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Once this assignment is made by Mr. Behn, what happens
after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. In regard to who, sir?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To your responsibilities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The overall.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, from that assignment by Mr. Behn, you
take charge; you execute; you make assignments and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Only one thing. I am not going to say that I don't make
assignments. Mr. Congressman, these people all work in a team form. We have
three shifts. They work together for a long time, and to say this, that they
knew each other's footprints, is probably an overstatement. But they know
each other's methods. Let me go back just one step further. I want to give it
clear to you.</p>

<p>Let's say the four or five stops that we had in Texas on this visit&mdash;we had one
overnight in Fort Worth. All right. Each time, each stop that we make, the
individual that we had sent out ahead to set up and coordinate the program
with the people in that area, whether it is security or otherwise, through communications
for the days he is away, he keeps us abreast of what is going on,
who to expect, and so forth.</p>

<p>And, again, I should say that in the morning of the 22d in Fort Worth, this
lad called me&mdash;Mr. Lawson&mdash;asked about the top, whether it should remain
on or off, which decision was reached from Mr. O'Donnell. I then asked him&mdash;I
said, "Are we going to be all right in Dallas?" He said, "Oh, yes; it is a good
program." Fine. If and when we ever arrived at that spot, I would ask this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
man, is there anything unusual when we get here. That is a general question
that I have given these people all the time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, once the assignment has been made
that you handle this trip, and in this case there was first a stop at El Paso,
then at <span class="locked">Houston&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. San Antonio.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. San Antonio; then Houston, Fort Worth. You stayed
overnight at Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Then you proceeded to Dallas on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Correct; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As I understand it, when you arrived at San Antonio,
the man that is in charge there, you immediately contacted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you go to Houston, the same process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Fort Worth, the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And when you got to Dallas, when you arrived there,
whom did you see first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Mr. Lawson.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And what did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. He said, "Your program is all set. We have all the equipment
and there should be no problem here." Fine.</p>

<p>Let me go back to Fort Worth again. On that night we had an overnight.
The gentleman we had working that stop had an added thing thrown into him,
which was the speech before breakfast. The President spoke to a crowd across
the main street in front of the hotel. After the President retired that night,
he and I went down to that parking lot. I said, show me where this man is
going to be, where the platform is going to be, where are you going to have
all these folks, and how close are they going to be; show me. He did.</p>

<p>You have got to keep abreast of these things, Mr. Congressman. Well, it is
your job.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Were all of these men that had charge of these various
operations in San Antonio, Houston, Fort Worth, Dallas, men of experience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much; very much so. I want to give you a little information
on how these people are selected for doing your advance work out of
Washington. In the first place, when they are brought in, you instruct them
on everything you do securitywise around the White House. You instruct them
in rangework, followup car work, every little phase entailed. Then say you
have a little movement in town&mdash;the President has a press conference, as an
example. He doesn't do that. Send him with an older fellow. Even if he just
walks around, learn it. Take him another place, a departure from an airport,
or a theater. Give him four or five. Then give him one, give him a little departure
at an airport, or a hotel. But have somebody with him. Then there is
no mistake made.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, when these men are assigned to handle the responsibilities
in a particular city, such as Lawson in Dallas, is Lawson on the staff
here or is he a man from Dallas with the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. These are all people we have in the White House detail, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, Lawson was a White House detail man
from Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right, sir.   He is one of the men off those three shifts.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, when was your assignment made as the man in
charge of this particular operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Oh, I am going to say a week ahead, for lack of a better
time&mdash;in fact, I knew that much of it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. <span class="locked">November&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Say the 17th, for a better day.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On or before November 17th you got this assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Surely. I knew that I was making a trip, and none of the
other two gentlemen were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What did you do after you got this assignment&mdash;what
steps did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. OK. The steps that I took&mdash;this entails work right here
in Washington. First, to determine, to staff people in the White House, who
is all going to make it, who are the passengers. This is a thing that those
advance people out in the field do not know when they leave. You set up the
time schedule&mdash;flight time&mdash;because the people on the other end want you there
at 11:30 in the morning, you have to work back a flight time from Washington,
or the helicopter time from the White House. All this is incorporated.
Weatherwise&mdash;you will use an automobile. Allow a little more time. All right.</p>

<p>From the people that are out in the field on those 4 or 5 different spots, they
are the ones that coordinate with the local folks what program they would
like, which is forwarded back, conferred with staff people, whether it is approved,
disapproved, added, or cut out. And about the day before you leave,
then it is all gelled.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But this is your principal responsibility, to pull everything
together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, according to the various reports we have, when
you know you are going to a particular city, or several cities, you have a method
or a procedure to check to see if there are any individuals or organizations that
present a serious threat to the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. We have what we call a Protective Research
Section. This has been in existence for many years, through Roosevelt's
days&mdash;I will go back that far. Through the combined efforts of various sources,
through other agencies, they have a file on all the, let's say dangerous, for a
better word, people that could be suspected in the city he arrives in. They
will furnish the agents on those three shifts, if there are a number of them, or
even one&mdash;it doesn't make any difference&mdash;all the data possible on that person&mdash;it
will be given to each shift. It is a report form; can be read by all. And, if
possible, there is a photograph included. That will be circulated around.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, when you got your assignment on or about
November 17, what did you do in this regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. One little thing I should say. Well, I am sorry. One of the
first things we do, when a trip is planned, is make a call on that PRS Section
and tell them, "On November 21 we are going to be in San Antonio, Houston, and
Fort Worth. On the 22d we will be in Dallas, Austin, and at the ranch." And
they take it from there, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So, on or about November 22d, you made this inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. This inquiry, sir, would be made a week ahead of time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A week ahead of the date that you were appointed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who would make that inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That would be made by any one of the three people&mdash;Mr.
Behn, Mr. Boring, or myself, or one other person which I interrupted you a
second ago. A departure is given to one man from one of the shifts who would
set up a departure from the White House to Andrews. He, too, in turn notifies
our Protective Research Section of this thing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, do you know who in this case for this trip made
that inquiry of the Protective Research Section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't have the name right now.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would there be a record of that made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think we ought to have that for the record&mdash;the time
it was made. You don't recall making it yourself, however.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you know if it was actually done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is always done, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I know. But do you know if it was done in this case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not for a fact; no.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But you must assume it was done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Very much so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Were you given the information from this inquiry, even
though you didn't make it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. What kind of information, sir?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, about those people who are considered dangerous
or a problem in any one of these four or five cities where the President was
going on this trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I will have to check this, but there was no record.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other <span class="locked">words&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No information.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, PRS never turned over to you any
information about any dangerous individuals in any one of these communities
on this trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is this unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes. But let me reserve the right to recheck that question
again; may I?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Absolutely. All we want in this case, as in any other,
are whatever the facts are to the best of records that are available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In the report from the Secret Service it says, and I
quote, "Because of the incidents on the occasion of the visit of Ambassador
Stevenson to Dallas earlier in the fall, special attention was given to extremist
groups known to be active in Dallas. Appendix A describes the action taken in
Dallas in more detail." Were you familiar with that part of the Secret Service
activity prior to your departure for Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I have knowledge of that; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How much knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. But not enough to be written up, that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, could you describe for the Commission what knowledge
you did have in this regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The only knowledge I can describe to you, sir, is the fact
that we were aware of what this Ambassador went through down there. However,
we had no information that such an incident would happen to President
Kennedy on his trip into that State.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But I gather from this report, which is the official report
of the Treasury Department, that somebody knew of these previous incidents,
and was thereby alerted to the possibility of&mdash;the potential of one, because the
report says, "Special attention is given to extremist groups known to be in
Dallas." Now, could you tell us what special attention was given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No. Outside of the fact that everybody was alerted to this
previous incident.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. PRS, Protective Research Section, didn't tell you, as
the person in charge, of any individuals or of any groups that wanted special
attention? I am using "special attention" as in the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Right as of this minute, the only knowledge that I have of
any incident that could happen was in San Antonio, when I believe we had information
of some pickets. Now, those pickets showed up outside of&mdash;he made a
speech at that space hospital. Well, anyway, in view of that, I cannot reach
the name right now&mdash;these pickets were out at, let's say, the main gate to the
grounds, and just stayed right there with their placards.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Also on the report it says, "In accordance with the
usual practice, the local FBI office informed the local Secret Service office of
any information which affected the President's visit."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. They did. That is the normal practice.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was the normal procedure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It is always the normal procedure; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, whom would they have informed in this case in
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Their report would have come to Washington, and relayed to
our Protective Research Section.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And the FBI in this instance gave you what information,
if any, that you should relay back to the <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. The only thing I can recall right now, sir, are those pickets
in San Antonio.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, may I say if on your return to your office you
find any information on this particular point, I think it would be very helpful
for the record, and it should be included in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. All right. I surely will.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The report also says, "On October 30, 1963, the local
FBI office gave the local Secret Service officer the name of a rightwing individual
in the Dallas area. An investigation was made. On November 21 and 22 the
local FBI office referred two pieces of information to the local Dallas office of
the Secret Service." Were you familiar with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who would, under your normal procedures, have been
familiar with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. It would be the same organization, Protective Research
Section.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But they did not give you any information of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is this unusual or different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. If they evaluated this information, there would have to be a
degree of seriousness.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But, as far as you can best recollect at this point, you
were never so informed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, indeed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The report does go on to say, and I quote, "One involved
scurrilous literature already in the hands of the Secret Service, Exhibit 4.
The second involved possible picket trouble which the local police were aware
of." That is the picket trouble you were talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Apparently so.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The report also says on page 8, "Special Agent Lawson,
SAIC Sorrel, and Special Agent Howlett met with Dallas law-enforcement officials.
Special Agent Howlett also met with an informant. They followed up
all leads and tips and checked scurrilous literature, Exhibit 4." Did you have
any information personally about this activity by Lawson, Sorrel, and Howlett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it their responsibility to do it, to undertake that
kind of an operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Everybody but Lawson. These other two gentlemen you
are speaking of are field agents out of Dallas. Yes; they would investigate
the seriousness of this thing, through the information furnished by the FBI.
And, depending on the degree now, this would be furnished our Protective
Research Section here in Washington.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, did Lawson or anybody else communicate to you
what was going on in this regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, no. I do not think Mr. Lawson got in this investigative
part at all. It would not be any part of his duties.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I am only reading from the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And the report goes on to say, "Their investigations did
not bring to light the name or the individual Lee H. Oswald, and he or his name
was not known to them or any other Secret Service agent in Dallas or elsewhere
prior to this shooting of the President." Would that be the same as
far as you are concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is very true.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You did not know of Lee H. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it surprising to you that when the President was
going to a city as large as Dallas, that there were no names turned over to you,
either by your Protective Research Section or by any other Federal agents&mdash;individuals
or an individual dangerous to the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I recall, to give you an answer, Congressman, that it did
seem strange that here we are hitting five cities in one State and&mdash;and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the apparent trouble Ambassador Stevenson had down there one evening, we
certainly should have had some information on somebody.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Hypothetically, if you go to other large metropolitan
areas, do you normally get names from various agencies, including PRS, warning
you of an individual or groups that might cause trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Again I say that our PRS would recheck their files, from
all the cities&mdash;from all the cases that they have in that city, and furnished
us information, whether a report or photographwise. They in turn would&mdash;and
I believe I am correct on this&mdash;they in turn notify the Bureau of this
visit, or may have people check through their files. They can doublecheck this
stuff. I don't recall any information whatsoever, except that picket thing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is surprising to me, as well, and I gather it was certainly,
on reflection, surprising to <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this in itself any warning to you that there might
be some breakdown in the system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Gee&mdash;no; I never cherished that thought, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You assumed that the proper liaison between various
agencies was taking place, and your PRS was operating effectively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Oh, yes; very much; yes indeed. Now, if I am wrong,
when I check these two questions back here, I will let you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Congressman Ford, on this line, perhaps I should say that
organizationally we are divided into phases where this is a separate phase in
terms of protective devices. So, for the prepared part of what the staff has set
up, we have by design omitted that portion here, with later witnesses to go
into all these questions in some detail for the Commission.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I was trying to get from Mr. Kellerman&mdash;from his testimony
he was indicating that he was the person who from on or about November 17
had the responsibility. And I was trying to trace precisely how this
responsibility was carried through, up to the point where you started out
this morning. Do I understand, then, that at some later point in the Commission
hearings with other witnesses we will go back into the process of how
these decisions are made, as far as PRS is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir. There will be detailed witnesses on the workings of
PRS, and how they functioned with respect to this trip, and what information
the FBI had or the State Department had about Lee Harvey Oswald, and
whatever coordination, if any, was present. Our thought was that that would
be handled separately, organizationally. Certainly, to some extent it is impossible
to draw sharp lines of distinction here. But that is the way the
staff has prepared the distinctions&mdash;with Mr. Kellerman going more specifically,
as the other witnesses of today, on the sequence of events themselves at
the assassination.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But, as far as the procedures within PRS and the relationship
between the Secret Service, the FBI, and other Federal agencies,
that will come up later on in other witnesses who are more familiar with the
precise workings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Exactly; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who actually had the responsibility to check the route
from the airport to the Trade Mart? I mean to check the route, lay out whatever
security precautions should be taken from the outset until the day of the
President's visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That was coordinated, Mr. Congressman, between Mr. Lawson
and members of the Dallas Police Department, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You did not arrive in Dallas until the morning of the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As you were in the car, in the right front seat, and the
car turned from Main Street right into Houston, you had for a relatively short
period of time an opportunity to look at the Texas School Depository Building.
Did you look at it; did you notice anything about it? What was your reaction,
if any, to that particular building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Not knowing the name of the building&mdash;let me say this:
When you are driving down this street, regardless of Houston or which, and
you have buildings on either side of you, you are going to scan your eyes up
and down this building.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did this building create, as you turned into Houston
Street, any particular problem that would have alerted you one way or another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. None whatsoever. It did not produce a thing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Your eyes scanned the area. Did they scan sufficiently
to identify anything, to be alerted by anything in any window, on the roof, or
anyplace else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Mr. Lawson or anybody else indicate to you at any
time that the Book Depository Building was a problem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I mean beforehand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Never mentioned it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Mr. Lawson or anybody else discuss with you any
particular danger involved in the overpass, the triple overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you have minute knowledge as to the route in Dallas,
or was that left up to Lawson in his judgment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Left up to Lawson and the people in Texas.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But he did tell you when you arrived in Dallas; what,
again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. And the people in Texas, the police department.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What did he tell you? When you arrived in Dallas
that morning, he told you something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir. He said, "This is your reception committee, which
is at the bottom of the ramp leading out." I said, "Are we all right in Dallas
here all the way for today?" And he said, "Yes; this will be fine." I said,
"All right; let's get on with it."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When were you first interviewed by anyone regarding
the directions from which the shots came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I don't recall ever being interviewed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever make a statement for submission to the
Commission or to your supervisors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Just this statement that I submitted here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Which is included in the Secret Service report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you have anything to do with setting up the method
of trying to apprehend the alleged assassin? Was that outside or within
your jurisdiction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Outside, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You did nothing in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe that is all. I have to go back to a very important
committee meeting, Mr. Chairman. I may be able to get back later,
Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I will be here the rest of the afternoon, so there will be no
necessity of your coming back if you are tied up. Thank you very much for
presiding all day.</p>

<p>Mr. Specter, have you some more questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I have just one or two other questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Kellerman, you referred to a single statement which you said you had
made. In the report of the U.S. Secret Service on the assassination of President
Kennedy, on Exhibit 12, statement 11&mdash;we have the first statement which you
made, which is four pages, and that is the one to which you referred, to refresh
your recollection earlier today, and I show you what appears to be a second
very brief report which you made 1 day later under date of November 30, 1963,
with your name and initials, and ask you if you made this one, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. You referred to you and Mr. Boring being the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
assistant special agents in charge. Is that status the same at the present
time, or are there now three assistant special agents in charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. There are three. Mr. Rufus Youngblood is the third one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has that slight shift been made since the time of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, those are my only additional questions, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Craig, would you like to ask any questions, or do you
think of any other avenue that we should explore here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No, sir; thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. As the interrogation has
progressed, I have been handing notes to counsel and he has been very kind in
asking those questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Murray, can you think of anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>. No, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Mr. Kellerman, is there any special agent in charge of the protection
of the person next in line in succession, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. I think Mr. Rowley would like to man that. I think they
have had a little difficulty to find a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. There is no such person now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. No, they have made numerous attempts with the people,
and so far they have got a negative reply.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mr. Kellerman, thank you very much, sir, for your
attendance and for your testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kellerman</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Now, Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We will call Mr. Greer.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Greer, how do you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Greer, will you raise your right hand and be sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth before this Commission, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Would you be seated, please.</p>

<h2 id="wrg">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM ROBERT GREER, SPECIAL AGENT,
SECRET SERVICE</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. William Robert Greer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By whom are you employed, Mr. Greer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The Treasury Department, Secret Service Division of the Treasury
Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old are you at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Fifty-four years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you been with the Secret Service Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I have been with the Secret Service Department since October 1,
1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I have just education in public schools in Ireland, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I took courses here in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you a high school graduate, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, I have 2 years of high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did you complete this educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I have to go back now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. About 1924 or 1925.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline in a general way what your activities have
been since that time, up until your joining the Secret Service, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir. I was born and raised on farmwork, a farmer. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
I done that until I came to this country in February 1930. I worked for a
period of time&mdash;I lived in Boston for a little while. I worked one summer on
the estate of Henry Cabot Lodge. I was a chauffeur for a family in Brookline,
Mass., for about a year. And then I went to New York, Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
I lived there for 13 years as a chauffeur for a private family in Dobbs Ferry,
N.Y. Then I went in the Navy in November 1942. I got discharged on September
18, 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your principal duties while in the Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I was seaman first class. I did almost 2 years at Bainbridge, Md.,
with the seaman guard there. And then I was assigned to the presidential
yacht in May 1944, until I was discharged in September. But most of my duty
was at the White House in that period, that year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long after discharge from the Navy was it before you
joined the U.S. Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, I got out of the Navy September 18 and October 1 I went
with the Secret Service&mdash;a matter of 14 or 15 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe your duties since joining the Secret Service, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Since joining the Secret Service I was assigned to the uniform
force at first with the Secret Service at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
For about 2 years I was with the physical education part of it. We
had a gymnasium there. I was an instructor there part-time&mdash;part of the
time. And then I was assigned for about 2 years to pick up the food of the
President at the White House. I had that duty for about 2 years. And then
I went back to the Treasury for a short period, a few months. And then I
was reassigned to the White House as an agent in November&mdash;1950 I went,
there. I was made a full agent that following August 1951. I was there as a
special officer from November to August 1951.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you been assigned to the White House staff since
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; I have been there ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And while assigned at the White House staff, how much of your
duty has involved driving the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, I drove the followup car for quite a long time&mdash;you know,
off and on. And then I drove the President at intervals during President Truman's
and President Eisenhower's terms. I was also assigned a great many
times to Mrs. Eisenhower. When she left Washington, I was always assigned
to her, to travel with her. And I have been assigned to the President, to drive
the President, since election day, with President Kennedy. I was the senior
agent assigned to him, to drive him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you get to Dallas yourself back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I flew&mdash;I was on a plane with the President all during the trip.
And I flew from Fort Worth to Dallas that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Greer, I hand you documents which have been marked
Commission Exhibits 344, 345, and 346. I ask you if you can identify those,
starting with 344, what that depicts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; I can identify this automobile very well. That is the
1961 Lincoln, especially built for the President. And this is a rear view of that
same automobile. This is the interior of that Lincoln Continental. Yes, sir,
everything is very positive that I can identify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did that automobile&mdash;how was that automobile transported
to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was flown there in a C-130.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you know where it was flown to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, it was flown&mdash;let's see, I forget the day before where our
first stop was on that trip right now. I would have to go back into my papers. But
we used I believe more than one stop. I am trying to think where we used it
before we went to Dallas. It could have been at Houston. I am not too sure
whether we used it at Houston the day before or not. I would have to go back
in my records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it possible the first time you used the automobile on that
Texas trip was at Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Right now it is so long ago, I have almost forgotten whether we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
did use it at Houston prior to that or not. I am not too sure where the first
stop was. We sometimes use it more than one stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any covering which can be put on the President's automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. There is&mdash;when we put the plastic&mdash;I put the plastic on it, we
have a black canvass-type cover that buttons over the top of the plastic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you please describe in a general way the plastic covering
you just referred to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The plastic covering is made in six pieces. Three of them&mdash;there
are two corner pieces and a centerpiece on the back that we fasten together
before we set it up onto the car. Then there is a front&mdash;one piece that goes
across the front seat after that. Then the last pieces we put on are two that
go in the center, and they meet together in the center&mdash;they come together in
the center. That makes the six pieces that it comes down in. We have to break
it down in the six pieces to store it in the trunk. It is kept in the trunk of the
car whenever we are not using it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are the three pieces that you described as being joined together
for the rear portion disassembled at all times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. We disassemble them to store them in the trunk, yes, sir. But
we put them together on the floor, on the ground or something like that&mdash;we put
the three pieces together, then we lift it up and set it in place, which covers
the back seat of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And after you put the three pieces together for the back portion
of the car, how many additional pieces are there for the balance of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Three; three more pieces.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how are they secured to the automobile itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. They are secured with&mdash;I don't know what you would call it&mdash;these
fasteners, snaps, kind of snaps that snap on them. We have them made
that way so that we can install them or take them apart very fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is this cover transparent? Can it be seen through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The plastic; yes. You can see through it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the plastic made of, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, it is a type of plastic. I just don't know who manufactures
it. But it is clear plastic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it bulletproof or bullet resistant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. It is weather&mdash;the idea back of it was for inclement
weather, that the President could be seen if the weather was too bad to have
him outside. That is what we had in mind originally with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any personal knowledge of any efforts made to
obtain a bulletproof or bullet-resistant transparent top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Now, or before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, start beforehand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No; I never had anything to do with that at all. I never had anything
to do with anything being made for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what efforts have been made subsequent to the
assassination of President Kennedy to obtain such a bulletproof transparent top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Only just hearing conversation; nothing definite; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately what time, to the best of your recollection, did
President Kennedy arrive in Dallas on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would have to&mdash;I would not tell you right now. I would have
to go back and look into my&mdash;you probably have it there. I have it also on my
report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you don't recall the exact time, just give us your best estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Approximately 11:35. I am guessing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was his mode of transportation into Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. He flew on an Air Force plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did he fly from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. From Fort Worth to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you tell us in a general way what he did upon arrival
in Dallas at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir. He got off the plane. He walked along the fence
along there, and shook hands with a great many people. There was a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
crowd there. He and Mrs. Kennedy both walked along and shook hands with
many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, approximately how long after arrival at Love Field did
he get into his automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would guess probably, say, approximately maybe 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the weather conditions like that day as he got
into his automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The weather was very nice that day. It was a beautiful
day in Dallas, very fine day, warm, fairly warm, nice day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the car open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The car was open; no top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how many automobiles were there in that
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I wouldn't have&mdash;couldn't tell you right now how many. There
was quite a few cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who were the occupants of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. On the back seat, on the right rear seat, the President, Mrs.
Kennedy on the left rear seat, Governor Connally was on the right jump
seat, and Mrs. Connally was on the left jump seat. Mr. Kellerman was
riding on the right front, and I was driving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what speed did you travel as you proceeded at various
points from Love Field, say, down into the downtown area of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, we traveled at various speeds, according to the amount
of people, the crowd. If it was&mdash;if we came to a large crowd, we would
have to slow down. I would say, to probably 10 to 15 miles an hour. Then
we would pick it up possibly 25 or somewhere around&mdash;25 maybe to 30,
where there was few people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the maximum speed at which you drove from the
time you left Love Field until the time you got to downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I wouldn't have the slightest idea now, after this length of
time. I could not say how much it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give us your best estimate on the minimum speed
from the time you left Love Field until the time you arrived at downtown
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The minimum speed traveling at all would probably be 10 to
15 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what sort of crowds were along the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. There was large crowds&mdash;at some places there was quite large
crowds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anything unusual occur en route from Love Field to the
downtown area of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, I think&mdash;it may have been&mdash;we may have stopped one
time where he got out&mdash;didn't get out, but he stopped and spoke to some
young people, I believe, en route. I think there may have been a group of
people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I hand you a photograph which has already been marked
Commission Exhibit No. 347 and ask you if at this time you are able to
identify what that photograph depicts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir. That is the photograph of the route that we traveled in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit No.
348 and ask you if you can identify what that picture represents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. With pictures that I have seen since then, I would recognize
that as the Book Depository Building in Dallas&mdash;the street in front of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you familiar with the name of this street, which has
since been marked by Mr. Kellerman, who identified this exhibit and marked
the name of the street on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, I wasn't at the time, but I know now that it is supposed
to be Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you know in what general direction Main Street
proceeds?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I am not too sure. No; I wouldn't really know. I didn't have
enough time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you familiar with the street which intersects with
<span class="locked">Main&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what street did you turn off of from Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Houston to Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as you were proceeding down Main Street, which I will
add is in a generally westerly direction, what is your best estimate of your
speed as you turned the corner right onto Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would estimate the speed was somewhere between 12 to 15
miles per hour, coming through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And as you made that right-hand turn onto Houston Street,
what was the composition of the crowds along the way, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. On Main Street there were very, very large crowds. They were
almost close up against the automobile. Sometimes the motorcycles on the
sides could not even get through. They were real close to us. And very large
crowds. And when we got around on Houston Street, the crowds thinned out
quite a lot. My recollection here is that there wasn't too many people on
Elm Street&mdash;a few scattered people at that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And your finger indicated there the position near the Texas
School Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you have described motorcycles. How many were present
with the President's automobile, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I could not tell the exact amount of motorcycles that were escorting
us at that time. We usually do have them on the two front fenders and
two rear fenders, and some probably preceding that, and some along the motorcade
behind us. I could not tell you exactly how many there probably would
be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect that there were some on this occasion, however?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; there were motorcycles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, do you know how many cars back your car was in the
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No; I don't know how many police cars were ahead of us. I
knew that the lead car was right directly ahead of me, with one of our agents,
or maybe two, and the chief of police in that car. But how many police cars
prior to that, I do not know how many there were at the time in front of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far ahead of you was that police car as you turned off of
Main Street onto Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I usually allow 4 or 5 car lengths, if possible, between the car and
myself, in case that there is any reason to speed up quick. I like to leave
enough room that I can get out of there. I don't like to get too tight to the lead
car when possible&mdash;unless the crowds are so big that I have to get in or they
would close in on me&mdash;I have to get in closer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how far behind you the first car immediately
behind yours was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The car behind me was only some few feet, because with our training
and all, we stay very, very close to the President's car. Sometimes we are
bumper to bumper. And the car never is much more than 10 to 12 feet away
from the President's car, at slow speeds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you endeavor to maintain a constant speed in the operation
of the President's car so as to avoid contact with this close gap between the
President's car and the President's follow-up automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir. We tried to drive at a very steady speed. We are
used to driving with each other, and we almost can tell each other's thoughts
what we do, because of the training we have had, and we work so long together.
We drive at a steady pace of speed, so that we give each other enough ample
time to stop or move in close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After turning off Main onto Houston, did you have any opportunity
to take a look at the building which you have since identified as the Texas
School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. I had not any chance to look much at that building at all.
When I made the turn into Elm Street, I was watching the overpass expressway&mdash;the
overpass, or what was ahead of me. I always look at any&mdash;where I
go underneath anything, I always watch above, so if there is anyone up there
that I can move so that I won't go over the top of anyone, if they are unidentified
to me, unless it is a policeman or something like that. We try to avoid going
under them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, when you turned off of Houston onto Elm, did you make
a right-hand or a left-hand turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I made a right-hand turn off of Main onto Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you turned from Houston onto Elm, was that a right-hand
or a left-hand turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. That was a left-hand turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And as you turned onto Elm Street, how far, to the best of your
ability to estimate, was your automobile from the overpass which you have just
described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I wouldn't have a distance recollection at all on how far it was.
It wasn't too far. I just could not give you the distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At that time, did you make a conscious effort to observe what
was present, if anything, on that overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir. I was making sure that I could not see anyone that might
be standing there, and I didn't see anything that I was afraid of on the overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anything at all on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Not that I can now remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best recollection of the speed at which you were
traveling as you turned left off of Houston onto Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. My best recollection would be between 12 and 15 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far were you at that time behind the police car which
was in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Probably 50 feet maybe&mdash;approximately. I will say approximately
50 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you turned onto Elm, did you have any opportunity to observe
how far behind you the President's follow-up car was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. I was not looking in my mirror; I could not say how far it
was behind me at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the nature of the crowd as you made the turn onto
Elm Street, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. To the best of my memory, the crowd had thinned out a great
deal, and there was not too many people in front of that building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many lanes of travel were there on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was either three or four lanes wide. I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what portion of the street were you traveling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I was right in the center of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe for us the contour of the street at that
point&mdash;whether it was level, hilly, or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was starting to go down&mdash;gradually going down toward this
underpass. It was a down grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you tell us just what occurred as you were proceeding
down Elm Street at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, when we were going down Elm Street, I heard a noise that
I thought was a backfire of one of the motorcycle policemen. And I didn't&mdash;it
did not affect me like anything else. I just thought that it is what it was.
We had had so many motorcycles around us. So I heard this noise. And I
thought that is what it was. And then I heard it again. And I glanced over my
shoulder. And I saw Governor Connally like he was starting to fall. Then
I realized there was something wrong. I tramped on the accelerator, and at
the same time Mr. Kellerman said to me, "Get out of here fast." And I cannot
remember even the other shots or noises that was. I cannot quite remember any
more. I did not see anything happen behind me any more, because I was
occupied with getting away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, how many shots, or how many noises have you just
described that you heard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I know there was three that I heard&mdash;three. But I cannot
remember any more than probably three. I know there was three anyway that
I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have an independent recollection at this moment of
having heard three shots at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I knew that after I heard the second one, that is when I looked
over my shoulder, and I was conscious that there was something wrong, because
that is when I saw Governor Connally. And when I turned around again, to the
best of my recollection there was another one, right immediately after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To the best of your ability to recollect and estimate, how much
time elapsed from the first noise which you have described as being similar to
the backfire of a motor vehicle until you heard the second noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It seems a matter of seconds, I really couldn't say. Three or four
seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much time elapsed, to the best of your ability to estimate
and recollect, between the time of the second noise and the time of the third
noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The last two seemed to be just simultaneously, one behind the
other, but I don't recollect just how much, how many seconds were between
the two. I couldn't really say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe as best you can the types of sound of the second report,
as distinguished from the first noise which you said was similar to a motorcycle
backfire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The second one didn't sound any different much than the first one
but I kind of got, by turning around, I don't know whether I got a little concussion
of it, maybe when it hit something or not, I may have gotten a little
concussion that made me think there was something different to it. But so far
as the noise is concerned, I haven't got any memory of any difference in them
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe as best you can the sound of the third noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Just, to me it was similar, to the first two. They all sounded
practically the same to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You testified that at the second noise you glanced over your
shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which shoulder did you glance over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Right shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And describe or indicate how far you turned your head to the
right at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Just so that my eyes over, caught the Governor, I could see, I
couldn't see the President. I just could see the Governor. I made a quick
glance and back again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the movement of your head just then approximately the
same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You just indicated the turn of your head slightly to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. My eyes slightly more than my head. My eyes went more than my
head around. I had vision real quick of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Exactly where was Governor Connally when you first caught
him out of the corner of your eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. He was&mdash;he seemed to be falling a little bit toward Mrs. Connally,
to the left. He started to go over a little bit to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far did you catch his movement during the time
you were able to observe him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Just a second. He probably hadn't gotten his shoulder, he
hadn't fell down or anything. He probably was in a position such as I am
now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he fall to the rear or to the side or how?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. In my opinion, he fell toward Mrs. Connally which would be
to his left or to his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he fall then on his left shoulder and arm or in some
other way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. He appeared to me to be falling on his left shoulder when I
glanced. He had only started to move that way whenever he&mdash;when I saw
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to see anything of President Kennedy as
you glanced to the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't see anything of the President. I didn't look,
I wasn't far enough around to see the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you started that glance, are you able to recollect
whether you started to glance before, exactly simultaneously with or after
that second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was almost simultaneously that he had&mdash;something had hit,
you know, when I had seen him. It seemed like in the same second almost
that something had hit, you know, whenever I turned around. I saw him
start to fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you step on the accelerator before, simultaneously or after
Mr. Kellerman instructed you to accelerate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was about simultaneously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that it was your reaction to accelerate prior to the
<span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You had gotten that instruction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; it was my reaction that caused me to accelerate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect whether you accelerated before or at the
same time or after the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I couldn't really say. Just as soon as I turned my head back
from the second shot, right away I accelerated right then. It was a
matter of my reflexes to the accelerator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it at about that time that you heard the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; just as soon as I turned my head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the speed of the car at the
time of the first, second, or third shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would estimate my speed was between 12 and 15 miles per
hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the time all of the shots occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. At the time the shots occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now what, if anything, was Mr. Kellerman doing at the time
of the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I couldn't really speak for where he was watching, what part
of the street or the buildings or what he was watching at that time. I
don't really know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what Mr. Kellerman was doing at the time
of the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. He was sitting there in the front. No, sir; I don't know what
his action was then. I was watching the overpass, I wasn't looking his
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you were watching the overpass at that time, did you
observe anything on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Not that I can remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe that there was no one present on the
overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. My recollection, there may have been a police officer up there.
It is vague to me now everything that I had seen at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what Mr. Kellerman was doing at the time
of the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I couldn't say what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any radio communication between your automobile
and any of the other automobiles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who made that radio communication?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Kellerman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell us as precisely as you can when he made that radio
communication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. After he had said to me, "Get out of here fast." He got the
radio and called to the lead car, "Get us to a hospital fast, nearest hospital
fast."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether he said anything else at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. After he had said to me, he said, "12:30," and that is all I
remember him saying to me was 12:30, and he had communications with
the cars but I don't remember what he had said to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say just "12:30," or was it 12:30 used in a sentence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. He said "12:30." He looked at his watch, he said "12:30," and
we were in the underpass at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Greer, would you on Commission's Exhibit 347, mark
with an "A" as best you can indicate the position of the President's automobile
at the time of the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Do you want me to mark it on this exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Right there, that is right, that red pencil with an "A," a
small "A."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. This is the center, I would say [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark your best estimate as to the position of the
automobile at the time of the second shot with the letter "B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would have to guess how far I had traveled at that time. I
really wouldn't know. It was probably a little farther, only guessing how far I
would go. I am guessing as to the distance between them. Maybe farther but
I am only guessing to say at that. I wouldn't have any definite reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you make that "B" a little plainer, if you can?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you give us the best estimate in feet as to the distance
you traveled from the time of the first shot to the time of the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I could. Anything I would say would be
guessing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you be able to give us a meaningful mark on the overhead
photograph as to the position of your car at the time of the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. From this overhead. I probably was where this mark is here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you mark it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I will put it alongside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Put a little "C."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. This was for the third shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. This is "C." This not having an idea really of how much footage
is in there at all. I <span class="locked">wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I didn't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I said I wouldn't probably know, Mr. Chief Justice, how many feet
would be in that distance, I would be guessing how many feet.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opportunity to observe the overhead as you
were driving along after the last shot occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. I was fairly close to it, to the best of my memory, and
I was trying to watch then where I was going. I had to look ahead to see, I was
catching up on the lead car real fast, and I had to watch what was ahead of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How fast was it possible to accelerate your automobile at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, it is a very heavy automobile, and it does not pick up too fast
on account of the weight. I have never tested to see how many feet I could
travel in a second. I have never had any reason to test it to see how much I
could travel. But it was in low gear at that time, and that helps you to accelerate
a lot faster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you characterize it as a very rapid or a rapid acceleration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or how would you characterize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It is a very smooth car taking off anyway, and I would say it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
wasn't rapid. It is fairly fast in low gear but not rapid like a light car will be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does that car have an automatic transmission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what are the varieties of forward speeds in the vehicle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It has a low gear and then it has drive one and drive two. It has
two top gears. One has, one probably has, free wheeling more than the other.
The other is not a free wheeling gear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How fast can the car be driven in the low gear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would say safely you can drive it up to 40 miles an hour in low
gear. That is estimating it at 40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the time of the first shot until the time of the third shot,
was your car moving in a straight line or in an arc or how would you describe it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I was following the contour of the road, the center of the contour
of the road as it goes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the path of the contour of the road?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, at the time I didn't think much of it but it is a little, there
is a little bend in the road going to the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear anyone in the car say anything from the time
of the first shot until the time of the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Not to the best of my recollection, I don't remember.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Greer, did you hear anyone say anything from the time of
the third shot until the time of arrival at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I didn't hear, I can't remember hearing anyone
say anything at all. We were quite preoccupied to get to the hospital as fast
as we can, as we could, and that was my mind was really occupied on what I
was doing. I didn't hear anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what speed you were traveling at en route to the
hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I couldn't say. I was just getting through the traffic and
through the streets as fast as I could get through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have any estimate at all on speed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would estimate that I must have been doing 40 or 50, at least
50 miles an hour at times. We might have been going as fast as 50 miles an
hour, I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you accelerated your automobile, did you at any time
come alongside of or pass the police car in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I never passed it. I came up alongside one or two
motorcycle men and I called to them "get to a hospital fast". You know, I
called to them "hospital".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you led to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; I was led to the hospital by the police car who was
preceding me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any independent knowledge of the route from
where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the point of assassination to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you escorted by any other automobiles besides the police
car in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. We had motorcycles and I don't know if there were other police
cars out in front of that or not. I am sure there may have been, but I couldn't
say right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any radio communication between your automobile
and the hospital at any time prior to your arrival at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; not between the hospital and our car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Kellerman have any radio contact at all with anyone
in addition to that which you have already described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. He may have had some more communications to the car, the
lead car, but I can't remember what they were now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any bullets strike any portion of the car or
ricochet in any way during the course of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any bullets or fragments of bullets at rest in
the car after the shooting terminated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I left the car at the hospital and I didn't see
it any more until the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 349, Mr. Greer, and ask
if you are able to identify what that picture represents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. That represents the windshield of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; it looks like the windshield of the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now calling your attention to a small <span class="locked">arrow&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which points up on what appears to be an indentation, I ask
you if you&mdash;when was the first time, if at all, that you observed that indentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I didn't observe <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Until after I got back to Washington, until the car came back
to Washington. I saw it at the White House garage. It was the first time I
had ever noticed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On what date did you observe that indentation on the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. That was the day after, the 23, would be it. It would be the day
after the shooting. We got back from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what time of the day did you observe the car at the White
House garage on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was in the afternoon, I believe. I believe it was in the afternoon,
I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anyone call that indentation to your attention at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes; I was asked if I knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was it who asked you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I can't remember now who did say that, but I was shown that
indentation at the same time I was the break in the glass. I was shown both
and asked if I had known but I can't remember who might have asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you ever observed that indentation before the assassination
occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. I had never noticed it before at any time. I had never
seen it before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you ever had any occasion to examine closely that metallic
area to ascertain whether or not there was such an indentation prior to the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, it seems to me I would have prior to that had it been there
because I do take care of the car sometimes, and it had never been&mdash;I had
never noticed it at any previous time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit 350 and ask you if you are
able to state what that depicts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. That depicts a break or a shatter in the windshield of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does that picture accurately represent the status of the windshield
on the President's car at sometime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; that windshield looks real familiar to me on the
way <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time, based on your observation, did the windshield of
the President's car look like that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I had never seen that until the following day after it came back
from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But on November 23, did the President's car windshield look
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; it looked like there was a break that had a diamond, in
the windshield whenever I was shown that at the garage, the White House
garage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the size and scope of the crack the same as that which
is shown on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. That I wouldn't remember whether it was quite that large or not.
I don't believe it was that big. It might not have been but I wouldn't say for
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any crack on the windshield after the time of
the shooting on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't see it at all. I didn't know anything about it
until I came back, until the car came back and I was shown that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion on November 22, after the shooting,
to observe closely the windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. The only time I was in the car was going to the hospital
and I never&mdash;I didn't see the car any more. It was just from the shooting until
we got to Parkland that I was with the car. I left the car there and never did
see it until it was back at the White House garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to state with certainty there was no crack in that
windshield prior to the shooting on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; I am sure there was nothing wrong with that windshield
prior to that because I would have&mdash;it was almost in front of me and I examined
the car. I looked it all over when I got there. I saw it was clean and everything,
the windshield. I didn't see this ever at any time previous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Greer, I now call your attention to a windshield which has
been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 351, and I will ask you to take a look at
it and identify it for us, if you can, calling your attention first of all to the windshield
itself. Are you able to <span class="locked">state&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; this is the windshield that came out of the Lincoln.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That you were operating on the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe what cracks, if any, which you see now on that
windshield were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. When I <span class="locked">looked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you observed the automobile windshield on November 23,
the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. This little star, the star in here with the little star. These cracks
were not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now by these cracks you are <span class="locked">indicating&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. These.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The long cracks which radiate off from the center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. That is right. This was the only cracks that I could see was this
star-type fragment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. There you are indicating what would be described as the principal
point of contact which was present when you observed it on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Give me your best estimate on the diameter of the cracking of
the windshield as it existed on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. To the best of my estimate it would be these little stars that are
here, the little shatters that are here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would it be fair to say that you are indicating a circle with a
circumference or diameter of approximately an inch to an inch and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I don't think&mdash;it probably would be an inch. The whole diameter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately 1 inch as you estimate it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Excuse me, did you say you did not notice this crack
from the time that you drove the car after the shooting to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I had flags on the car and you know they were waving at
a high rate of speed and you have the Presidential flag and the American flag in
front of you there; you know when you are going at a fast speed you get a lot
of, well, I don't know how you would say it, it attracts you so much that I didn't
have any recollection of what happened on the windshield.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. There was no glass or anything that spattered on you
in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't feel anything at all. I didn't feel a thing hit me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
I was kind of shocked at the time, I guess anything could have and I wouldn't
have known what hit me. You are tense, I was pretty tense, and naturally my
thoughts were the hospital, and how fast I could get there, and probably I could
have been injured and not even known I was injured. I was in that position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Greer, what is your best estimate and recollection of the
time that the shooting occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, Mr. Kellerman saying 12:30 to me makes me&mdash;that stays in
my mind foremost, and that was when we had just left the scene of the shooting,
a few seconds or a second or two from it. That is why that 12:30 stays in my
mind, him saying 12:30 to me right after the shooting, he said. His watch may
not have been correct but that is what he said to me at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the distance between the point
where the assassination occurred and Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I haven't. It seemed like endless miles and probably
wasn't very far, but it seemed like to me it was endless getting there. I <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to give us an estimate with reasonable accuracy on
the time it took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the time it took from the point of the shooting until you
arrived at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I didn't check anything but I thought that probably it would probably
be 6 or 8 minutes. I am not too sure, somewhere in the vicinity of 5 and
10 minutes. I would have to guess at that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you know which entrance of the hospital to go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I followed the car that was in front of me right to where he
stopped and I was right at the entrance. The car stopped and I stopped alongside
of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which entrance was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It seems, I think it was the emergency entrance, I am almost sure.
It was like a bay that you could pull in and out of. It looked like an ambulance
entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe with respect to President Kennedy's
condition on arrival at the Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. To the best of my knowledge he was laying, it seemed across Mrs.
Kennedy, looked like laying across her lap or in front of her, I am not too sure
which, I opened the doors&mdash;the doors were opened before I got to it, someone
else had opened the doors and they were trying to get Connally out, and Mrs.
Connally out of the seats so they could get to the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe about the President with respect to his
wounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. His head was all shot, this whole part was all a matter of blood
like he had been hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the top and right rear side of the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; it looked like that was all blown off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I run around the front of the car and got hold of a stretcher or
thing and I got hold of it to keep it steady while they lifted the President's
body onto it and then I helped pull the front end of it into the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was first removed from the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Governor Connally was first removed. He was on the jump seats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, if anything, did you observe as to Governor Connally's
condition on arrival at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The best of my recollection he was lying across the seat toward
Mrs. Connally when they picked him up and got him out of the car. And he was
rushed in first into the hospital. That is when I got the stretcher to bring it,
to hold it until they would get the President on it, on the right side of the car.
They took him out on the side he was sitting on, that side of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to make any personal observation about Governor
Connally's specific wound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. I didn't know how badly anyone really was injured.
I had great thoughts the President was still living and that was the only thing
I was thinking about was to get them in quick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe anything specific which led you to the conclusion
that the President was still living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. When he was in the emergency room and I was there,
I did see his chest expand and move, the movement of the chest a time or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to observe any wound on the front side of the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't, I never seen any on the front side of the President.
The only thing I saw was on the head. I didn't know at the time of any other
injuries on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to the front side of the President's body, were you able to
observe any hole or tear in either his shirt or tie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't and I brought them back, those things, and I
didn't see them at the time. I probably didn't inspect them very closely but
they were handed to me in a paper bag to bring back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you acquire custody and possession of those items of
clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. After they had made the President's body ready for removal,
I was in the emergency room, and a nurse got two shopping bags and I held
them and she put the President's suit, his belongings into the two bags including
his shoes and socks, and his pants and jacket which they had torn and the shirt
they had torn, they had torn it to take it off him, and the nurse put these into
the two bags and I got custody of them right then from the nurse at the
emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other items of wearing apparel such as shorts
or undershirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; his shorts and that brace he wore, whatever it was,
and his sox and shoes, and shirt, and his trousers, and his suit coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to state with certainty that there was no undershirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; there was no undershirt. I am sure there was no undershirt.
I would have to say it to the best of my recollection, there was no undershirt.
I had been with him so many times and I knew he didn't normally wear
an undershirt because I had heard him one time previously, I offered him a coat.</p>

<p>He said, "I have an undershirt on today," it was at some ballgame. He normally
didn't wear an undershirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe with more particularity the brace you just
said he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It looked like a, I would say, a corset-type brace, maybe 6 inches
wide, he wore it around his, down low around his, haunches, a little lower than
the waist, probably, just probably below his belt he wore it there. It was
something he normally wore, and I would guess, but I would say it was of a soft,
maybe a kind of corset-type material, maybe elastic or something like that
support.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Greer, when your automobile arrived at Parkland, was there
any medical individual awaiting your arrival?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I can't remember&mdash;there were&mdash;who brought the stretchers out.
There were some hospital people there, but who they were, I never got&mdash;I
couldn't identify or knew who they were. There were some medical people
there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were they when you first saw hospital personnel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. When I pulled into the ambulance entrance there were some
people there on the right-hand side with these stretchers that they had rushed
out. I don't know just who they were from the hospital staff. There was a
great deal of confusion because everyone was trying to help, the agents were
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to state whether there was a doctor in attendance
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I couldn't state that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after your arrival at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I helped pull it, take the stretcher into the emergency room that
he was on. It is on wheels, and I helped to take that in, and I stayed inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
the door of the emergency room most of the time while they were, the doctors
were, working on the President's body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many doctors were working on him in the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. There were, between nurses and doctors. I would estimate there
were, between 10 or 12 people, maybe not that many, 8 to 10 people in and out of
that room. I don't know how many of them were doctors, attendants, nurses,
and things like that with white jackets and they would come in and say, "I am
doctor so-and-so."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were they working on him there in the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I couldn't remember the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say you were with him most of the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I was inside the door. I know, I kept the door closed most of
the time, let doctors and nurses in and out while he was&mdash;while they were
working on him. I stayed inside the emergency room door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any special reason for you to leave part of the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't go any farther away than outside the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other Secret Service agents inside the emergency
room at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Not at that time; I was inside the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was Mrs. Kennedy at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Mrs. Kennedy was outside the door. They got her a chair out
there for a little while and then she insisted on coming in and she got in the
corner for a little while there and stayed there a little while and I don't quite
remember the time she went over to his body but she did go over there, and I
don't remember how far along the doctors had been on him when that happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to overhear any of the conversations among
the doctors in the emergency room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I don't understand anything that they were discussing at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did a priest or more than one priest come upon the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I believe there were two. To the best of my recollection there
eventually was two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long after President Kennedy arrived at the emergency
room did the priest arrive, if you recollect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I wouldn't have any idea, it seemed to me it was quite
a little while in the matter, probably minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long did the priests stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I don't remember that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they say anything on leaving or in entering?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Not that I heard of personally. I was outside the room when
the priest was in there. I wasn't in the emergency room while he was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you find that the President had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. When the priest was in to give him the last rites then I knew that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any reasonably close estimate on when the President
did die?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I haven't right off. I would have to look at some reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after the President was pronounced dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. We stayed there until everything was settled up. I believe there
was a judge came in there and I think, someone came in and made the decisions
on removing the body and the casket was brought in, and the body was put
in the casket. I had this, his clothing, I kept it in my hand at all times, all
the time. Then I went, when they removed the casket from the emergency
room, I was in front of it going out to make a path to get it to the ambulance.</p>

<p>So, I helped get it into the ambulance and then I drove a car with some agents
and some people right behind the ambulance to Love Field back to the airport
again and helped to get the casket aboard the airplane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present at the swearing in of President Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; I was&mdash;we were all asked to come back into the state
room but I wasn't in too close. I was in the main part of the plane, as close
as I could get to it, yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you personally return to Washington, D.C.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I returned on Air Force 1 with the President's remains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at approximately what time did you leave Dallas to fly back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would have to look in my reports to say exactly. I would have
to go back on the times. Two something but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any idea of the time you arrived in the Washington
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I believe it was 6 or 6:15. As I say I have it in my reports but I
haven't looked at the times recently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you arrive in the Washington area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. At Andrews Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next in connection with this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I helped to get the casket out of the plane, and put it into a Navy
ambulance and then I drove that Navy ambulance to Bethesda Naval Center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do upon arriving at the Bethesda Naval Center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I stayed in, while the autopsy was being performed, I stayed in the
autopsy room with Mr. Kellerman and the doctors and the people who were in
there. I stayed in there and observed what was necessary that I could do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any Secret Service Agents present besides you and Mr.
Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the autopsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. There may have been, Mr. Hill may have come in and out but he
didn't stay there. Mr. Kellerman and I stayed permanently the whole time
there. There may have been, Mr. Hill may have come in there and have gone
back out but he didn't stay in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During the course of the autopsy did you hear any doctor say
anything about the wound on the right side of Mr. Kennedy's back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. That was the first time that I had ever seen it, when the doctors
were performing the autopsy, they saw this hole in the right shoulder or back of
the head, and in the back, and that was the first I had known that he was ever
shot there, and they brought it to our attention or discussed it there a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What conversation was there concerning the wound on the right
back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, the doctors and people who were performing the autopsy,
when they turned the body apparently over they discovered that this wound
was in the back, and they thought that they probably could get a bullet out of
there, and it took a lot of&mdash;then they took more X-rays, they took a lot of
X-rays, we looked at them and couldn't find the trace of any bullet anywhere in
the X-rays at all, nothing showed on the X-rays where this bullet or lead could
have gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately where in the President's back was the bullet hole?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was, to the best of my recollection it was, back here, just in the
soft part of that shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the upper right shoulder area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Upper right, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any effort made to probe that wound by any doctor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I believe, yes, I believe the doctors probed to see if they could find
that there was a bullet there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know which doctor that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I don't, I don't have their names at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did any doctor make any statement about the results of his
probing effort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I questioned one of the doctors in there about that, and when we
found out that they had found a bullet in Dallas, I questioned the doctor about
it and he said if they were using pressure on the chest that it could very well
have been, come back out, where it went in at, that is what they said at the time.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anything said about any channel being present in the body
for the bullet to have gone on through the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I hadn't heard anything like that, any trace of it going
on through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you just mention, Mr. Greer, a hole in the President's head
in addition to the large area of the skull which was shot away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No. I had just seen that, you know, the head was damaged in all
this part of it but I believe looking at the X-rays, I looked at the X-rays when
they were taken in the autopsy room, and the person who does that type work
showed us the trace of it because there would be little specks of lead where the
bullet had come from here and it came to the&mdash;they showed where it didn't come
on through. It came to a sinus cavity or something they said, over the eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the right eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>.   I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You don't know which eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I don't know which eye, I may be wrong. But they showed us the
trace of it coming through but there were very little small specks on the X-rays
that these professionals knew what course that the bullet had taken, the lead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe in very general terms what injury you observed
as to the President's head during the course of the autopsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would&mdash;to the best of my recollection it was in this part of the
head right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Upper right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Upper right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Upper right side, going toward the rear.</p>

<p>And what was the condition of the skull at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. The skull was completely&mdash;this part was completely gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, aside from that opening which you have described and
you have indicated a circle with a diameter of approximately 5 inches, would
you say that is about what you have indicated there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Approximately I would say 5 inches; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any other opening or hole of any sort in the
head itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't. No other one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Specifically did you observe a hole which would be below the
large area of skull which was absent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to look in the back of the head immediately
below where the skull was missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No; I can't remember even examining the head that close at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When President Kennedy was being treated in the emergency
room at Parkland Hospital, were any pictures or X-rays taken of him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; not that I know of. I didn't see any being taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he ever turned over that you observed while being treated
at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir. I can't recollect him ever being turned over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any recollection that he was in fact not turned
over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I couldn't even say. I didn't see them turn him over in
any way in my vision, although my back was to him quite often and because
I was attending to the door and they could have done it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he on a stretcher at the time he was being worked on at
Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I can't remember whether they changed him from a stretcher
to a table. I am not sure on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Greer, as to the return of the President's automobile to
Washington, do you know how that was accomplished?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It was driven to Love Field, and put aboard the same C-130 it
was taken out on and flown back to Andrews Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know when it was returned from Dallas to the Washington
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I believe it was returned shortly after, it left shortly after, the
President's plane left, was flown back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I hand you two photographs marked Commission Exhibit No.
352 and Commission Exhibit No. 353.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Do those photographs represent the condition of the back seat of the President's
car at some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what time do those pictures look just as the back seat
of the President's car looked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It looked like that when it came back from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did it look like that immediately after President Kennedy was
removed from the back seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I wasn't there any more, sir. I was with the President after they
lifted him out. I didn't see the car after he had been removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe the back seat of the car at any time from the
time you arrived at Parkland Hospital until you observed the automobile in
Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By the way, Mr. Greer, how much, approximately, does or did
the President's automobile weigh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. It weighed between&mdash;well, for flight reason we said 8,000, but
it wasn't that much. It probably was 7,500. We had extra weight on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to tell the Commission the dimensions of the
automobile, indicating its length?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir. It is 21 feet 8 inches long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how wide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I would have to go back for the width on it. I have it all in
black and white in the office, but I haven't got it with me in my head right
now; I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could three people sit comfortably in the front seat of the
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; it was wide enough for three. We many times had an
aide in there; many times, an aide rode in the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it as wide or wider than, say, a Cadillac automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; it would be probably the same width.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was that car specially made for the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; it was a specially built car.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was it a Lincoln Continental?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; a Lincoln Continental.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How did it differ from the ordinary Lincoln?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, Lincoln doesn't make a seven-passenger car, and this was
a seven-passenger car. The back seat on this car would raise 8 inches. It was
electric, and you could lift, you could raise, the seat up 8 inches from the ground,
from the floorboards. It had a little step that went with it. The President
could raise it up and down himself. He had a button alongside that would
cause it to go up and down when the top wasn't down. It wouldn't go up and
down when the top was down. But when it was off he could raise it up or down,
and it would be above the other seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether the seat was actually raised at the time
of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I couldn't say right off. I don't believe it was, but I
wouldn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going back to the shots themselves, Mr. Greer, do you have any
reaction as to the direction from which the shots came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. They sounded like they were behind me, to the right rear of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that be as to all three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir. They sounded, everything sounded, behind me, to me.
That was my thought, train of thought, that they were behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever had any reaction or thought at any time since
the assassination that the shots came from the front of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I had never even the least thought that they could come.
There was no thought in my mind other than that they were behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Boggs, are there any questions you would like
to ask the agent?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I don't think so, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever have any thought there were more than
three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I never did.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you positively identify the fact that there were one,
two, three, or was there one, and then a delay, and then a flurry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. To the best of my recollection, Congressman, was that the last
two were closer together than the first one. It seemed like the first one, and
then there was, you know, bang, bang, just right behind it almost. The two
seemed, the last two seemed, closer to me than the other.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you speed up after you heard the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. After I heard the second. The first one didn't sink into me, didn't
give me the thought that it was a shot. I thought it was the backfire of a motorcycle.
But when I heard the second one and glanced over my shoulder, I knew
something was wrong then. I didn't know how bad anyone was injured or
anything, but I knew there was something wrong, and right away after the second
one I accelerated as fast as I could.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Craig, would you like to ask any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>With respect to the position of the President's car that you were driving as
it approached the underpass, you state now that you couldn't fix any specific
distance. But would you say it was less than a mile that the President's car
was from the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Oh, definitely. I couldn't say in feet or yards, but it was within&mdash;it
was feet. I would say probably a hundred or 200 feet. It could be within
that; it was definitely right up close to me, but <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. With respect to your vision, was it unobstructed down the roadway,
looking at the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; there were no obstructions in the road that I could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. As I recall your testimony, you were actually observing the overpass
to see if there was any person there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. People up there at that time I would be doubtful of going underneath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes, sir. And you say now you do not recollect that you saw anyone
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. You said also, I believe, that it was some time now since you made
that observation. Did you make any report of any kind with respect to anyone
being on the overpass immediately after this incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. You made no written report to anybody as to whether or not there
were people on the overpass or were not people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Do you believe if you had observed people on the overpass at that
time you would now remember it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I would; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. If you had observed people on the overpass as you proceeded
toward it, and they were other than a policeman or policemen or some other
law-enforcement agent, what would you have done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Well, I try never to go underneath a bridge if there are people up
over it, if there are people who I don't know as law enforcement. I try not to
go underneath them. I will probably veer to one side of them at any time.
That is a matter of our training, that we try not to go underneath anyone with
an open car where anyone could drop something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Would you ever stop, if necessary, if you thought there were
people up there that you couldn't veer around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. If there was any danger there I would have to either change my
way of traveling. I have never had it happen, and never had any reason to,
but we try, I try, not to go underneath a group of people standing on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
overpass at any time. I try to move over, if the condition permits me to.
Sometimes, when the road is too narrow, I couldn't. But that is part of our
procedure, I think, to see that no one is on an overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. If there are no further <span class="locked">questions&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask one or two other questions?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I have just noted that we have the report of the FBI which
bears Bureau file No. 105-S, as it appears here somewhat indistinct, S-2555,
"Report of Special Agent Robert P. Gemberling, dated December 10, 1963," and
this refers, Mr. Greer, to an interview of you by Special Agents Francis X.
O'Neill, Jr., and James W. Sibert. There is a report here of an interview of you
and of Special Agent Kellerman, and the date here is listed as November 22,
1963, and there is this reference made in the report, and I will quote it verbatim:</p>

<p>"Greer stated that he first heard what he thought was possibly a motorcycle
backfire, and glanced around and noticed that the President had evidently been
hit. He thereafter got on the radio and communicated with the other vehicles
stating that they desired to get the President to the hospital immediately."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I didn't go on the radio. It was Mr. Kellerman who done the
radio talking. I didn't. It is a misquote if I done it. I didn't get on the
radio. Mr. Kellerman did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever make this statement, Mr. Greer, to Special Agent
O'Neill or Sibert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Those two agents were in during the autopsy; those two agents
were in the autopsy room, with Mr. Kellerman and I, all night. Mr. Sibert
and O'Neill were both in the autopsy room with us during that time, and the
only time that any of us, either Mr. Kellerman or I, we never left the room,
one or the other. We went and got some coffee and came right back, something
like that, and the FBI did the same thing. One of them left; the other stayed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you now recollect whether or not you ever said to them that
you were the one who communicated on the radio with the other vehicles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I know I never remember saying that to them because
I know I didn't do it. So that is how I know that I didn't say it, because I know
I didn't do it. Mr. Kellerman did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the first part refers to your noticing that the President
evidently had been hit. Did you <span class="locked">ever&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I have no recollection of ever telling the agents that I said that;
no, sir. If I said it, I don't remember saying it. The Governor was the person
that I knew was&mdash;when we were first in trouble, when I see the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To the best of your current recollection, did you notice that the
President had been hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I didn't know how badly he was injured or anything other
than that. I didn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know at all, from the glance which you have described
that he had been hit or injured in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I knew he was injured in some way, but I didn't know how bad or
what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. If I remember now, I just don't remember how I knew, but I
knew we were in trouble. I knew that he was injured, but I can't remember,
recollect, just how I knew there were injuries in there. I didn't know who all
was hurt, even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to recollect whether you saw the President after the
shots as you were proceeding toward Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No; I don't remember ever seeing him any more until I got to the
hospital, and he was lying across the seat, you know, and that is the first I
had seen of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Your best recollection is, then, that you had the impression he
was injured but you couldn't ascertain the source of that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Right. I couldn't ascertain the source.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you hear the President say anything after the first
shot?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; I never heard him say anything; never at any time did
I ever hear him say anything.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did Mrs. Kennedy say anything to you while you were
driving to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No, sir; she didn't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did Mrs. Connally say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. No. Mrs. Connally didn't say anything, either. There is quite a
little distance between the front and the back seat of that car. As you know, it
is 21 feet long, and you are quite a little bit away, and there was the sirens
were all going. The following car had a siren wide&mdash;the big one on the fender
was wide open. There wasn't much chance for me to hear anything, and I was
really occupied with getting there just as fast as I could and not seeing that
anything happened, avoid an accident or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have a siren on your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I didn't have mine going. There is a siren on that car, but I
didn't even reach down to work it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. There was another agent in the car with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Mr. Kellerman; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And after the first shot, did he say to speed up or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. I believe it was at the second that he and I both simultaneously&mdash;he
said, "Get out of here fast," and I speeded up as fast as I could then and as
fast as the car would go.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. If there are no further questions, thank you very much,
Mr. Greer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be excused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Greer</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will take a short recess.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Hill, come right in, sir. Would you raise your right
hand, please, and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you
give before this Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Would you be seated, please, Mr. Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Specter.</p>

<h2 id="cjh">TESTIMONY OF CLINTON J. HILL, SPECIAL AGENT, SECRET SERVICE</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Hill, would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Thirty-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I went to secondary educational high school in Washburn, N. Dak.,
and then went on to Concordia College, Moorehead, Minn. I was a history and
education major, with a minor in physical education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What year were you graduated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What have you done since the time of graduation from college,
Mr. Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I went into the Army in 1954; remained in the Army until 1957.
Then I couldn't determine what I wanted to do, whether to go to law school or
not, and I took a couple of odd jobs. I worked for a finance company at one time.
Then I went to work for the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad as a special
agent in the spring of 1958, and entered the Secret Service in September 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have been with the Secret Service since September 1958
to the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline for the Commission your duties with the
Secret Service during your tenure there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I entered the Secret Service in Denver, and during that period I
did both investigative and protection work. I was assigned to Mrs. Doud, the
mother-in-law of President Eisenhower. I attended the Treasury Law Enforcement
School during my first year, and was sent to the White House for a 30-day
temporary assignment at the White House in June 1959. In November of 1959,
November 1, I was transferred to the White House on a permanent basis as a
special agent assigned to the White House detail. I have been at the White
House since that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you assigned to duties on the trip of President
Kennedy to Texas in November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any special duty assigned to you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In connection with the trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I was responsible for the protection of Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, in a general way, what does that sort of an assignment
involve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I tried to remain as close to her at all times as possible, and in
this particular trip that meant being with the President because all of their
doings on this trip were together rather than separate. I would go over her
schedule to make sure she knows what she is expected to do; discuss it with her;
remain in her general area all the time; protect her from any danger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you tell us, in a general way, what were the activities
of the President and Mrs. Kennedy on the morning of Friday, November 22,
before they arrived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I went to the fifth floor, I believe it was, where the President and
Mrs. Kennedy were staying in the Texas Hotel in Fort Worth at 8:15 in the
morning. President Kennedy was to go downstairs and across the street to make
a speech to a gathering in a parking lot. I remained on the floor during the
period the President was gone.</p>

<p>It was raining outside, I recall. About 9:25 I received word from Special
Agent Duncan that the President requested Mrs. Kennedy to come to the mezzanine,
where a breakfast was being held in his honor, and where he was about to
speak. I went in and advised Mrs. Kennedy of this, and took her down to where
the President was speaking; remained with her adjacent to the head table in
this particular area during the speech; and accompanied she and the President
back up to the, I believe it was, the fifth floor of the hotel, their residential area;
remained on that floor until we left, went downstairs, got into the motorcade,
and departed the hotel for the airport to leave Fort Worth for Dallas.</p>

<p>We were airborne approximately 11:20, I believe, in Air Force 1. I was in the
aft compartment, which is part of the residential compartment, and we arrived
in Dallas at 11:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe, in a general way, what the President and
Mrs. Kennedy did upon arrival in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They debarked the rear ramp of the aircraft first, followed by
Governor and Mrs. Connally, various Congressmen and Senators. And Special
Agent in Charge Kellerman and myself went down the ramp. There was a
small reception committee at the foot of the ramp, and somebody gave Mrs.
Kennedy some red roses, I recall. I walked immediately to the followup car and
placed my topcoat, which is a raincoat, and small envelope containing some
information concerning the Dallas stop in the followup car, returning to where
the President and Mrs. Kennedy were at that time greeting a crippled lady in
a wheelchair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you estimate the size of the crowd to have been at
Dallas that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. At the airport?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It is rather difficult to say. They were behind a chain-link fence,
not on the airport ramp itself, and they were jammed up against the fence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
holding placards, and many young people in the crowd. I would say there were
probably 2,000 people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time did the motorcade depart from
Love Field to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately 11:55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know approximately how many automobiles there were
in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In which car in the motorcade were you positioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I was working the followup car, which is the car immediately behind
the Presidential car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how many cars are there ahead of the followup car, then,
in the entire motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There was a lead car ahead of the President's car, the President's
car, then this particular followup car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether there was any car in advance of the
car termed the lead car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There could have been a pilot car, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, approximately how far in front of the President's car
did the lead car stay during the course of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would say a half block, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far was the President's car in front of the President's
followup car during the course of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately 5 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there some well-established practice as to the spacing between
the President's car and the President's followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It would depend upon speed. We attempt to stay as close to
the President's car as practical. At high rates of speed it is rather difficult
to stay close because of the danger involved. Slow speeds, the followup car
stays as close as possible so that the agents on the followup car can get to
the Presidential car as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the first car to the rear of the President's followup
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The Vice-Presidential automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What car was immediately behind the Vice President's automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The Vice-Presidential followup car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what cars in the Dallas motorcade followed the
Vice President's followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I couldn't say which car any individual rode in after that
particular automobile, but I could say they were occupied by members of the
staff, both President Kennedy's and Vice President Johnson's; Congressmen
and Senators who were on this particular trip; newspaper personnel who were
on this trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you identify the occupants of the President's followup
car and indicate where each was in the automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The car itself was driven by Special Agent Sam Kinney, and Assistant
to the Special Agent in Charge Emory Roberts was riding in the right
front seat. I was assigned to work the left running board of the automobile, the
forward portion of that running board. McIntyre was assigned to work the
rear portion of the left running board. Special Agent John Ready was assigned
the forward portion of the right running board; Special Agent Paul Landis
was assigned the rear portion of the right running board. There were two
jump seats, and they were occupied by two Presidential aides, Mr. O'Donnell
and Mr. Powers. Mr. Powers was sitting on the right-hand side; Mr. O'Donnell
on the left. The rear seat was occupied, left rear by Special Agent Hickey,
right rear, Special Agent Bennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How were the agents armed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All the agents were armed with their hand weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there any weapon in the automobile in addition to the
hand weapons?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes. There is an AR-15, which is an automatic rifle, and a shotgun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where is the AR-15 kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Between the two agents in the rear seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the shotgun; where is that kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. In a compartment immediately in front of the jump seats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is the President's followup car a specially constructed automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the make and model and general description of
that vehicle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It is a 1955 Cadillac, nine-passenger touring sedan. It is a convertible
type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that automobile flown in specially from Washington for
the occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; it was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how that automobile was transported to Dallas,
Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Generally, it is flown in a C-130 by the Air Force. I am not sure
how on this particular occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe, in a general way, the composition of the
crowds en route from Love Field down to the center of Dallas, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, when we left Love Field, we went away from the crowd
to get to the exit point at Love Field, and there were no crowds at all,
and then we, departing Love Field, found the crowds were sporadic.
There were people here and there. Some places they had built up and other
places they were thinned out. The speed of the motorcade was adjusted
accordingly. Whenever there were large groups of people, the motorcade
slowed down to give the people an opportunity to view the President.
When there were not many people along the side of the street, we speeded
up. We didn't really hit the crowds until we hit Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the maximum speed of the
automobile from the time you left Love Field until the time you arrived at
downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would say we never ran any faster than 25 to 30 miles per
hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the minimum speed during
this same interval?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Twelve to fifteen miles per hour. We did stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On what occasion did you stop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Between Love Field and Main Street, downtown Dallas, on
the right-hand side of the street there were a group of people with a long
banner which said, "Please, Mr. President, stop and shake our hands." And
the President requested the motorcade to stop, and he beckoned to the
people and asked them to come and shake his hand, which they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the President disembark from his automobile at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; he remained in his seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At that time what action, if any, did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I jumped from the followup car and ran up to the left rear
portion of the automobile with my back toward Mrs. Kennedy viewing those
persons on the left-hand side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action was taken by any other Secret Service agent
which you observed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Special Agent Ready, who was working the forward portion of
the right running board, did the same thing, only on the President's side,
placed his back toward the car, and viewed the people facing the President.
Assistant in Charge Kellerman opened the door of the President's car and
stepped out on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action was taken by Special Agent McIntyre, if you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about Special Agent Landis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your normal procedure for action in the event the
President's car is stopped, as it did in that event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Special Agent McIntyre would normally jump off the car and
run to the forward portion of the left-hand side of the car; Special Agent
Landis would move to the right-hand forward portion of the automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anything else which was unusual occur en route from
Love Field to the downtown area of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Before we hit Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to leave the President's followup
car at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. When we finally did reach Main Street, the crowds had built
up to a point where they were surging into the street. We had motorcycles
running adjacent to both the Presidential automobile and the followup
car, as well as in front of the Presidential automobile, and because
of the crowds in the street, the President's driver, Special Agent Greer, was
running the car more to the left-hand side of the street more than he was
to the right to keep the President as far away from the crowd as possible,
and because of this the motorcycles on the left-hand side could not get past
the crowd and alongside the car, and they were forced to drop back. I
jumped from the followup car, ran up and got on top of the rear portion
of the Presidential automobile to be close to Mrs. Kennedy in the event
that someone attempted to grab her from the crowd or throw something in
the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say the rear portion of the automobile, can you,
by referring to Commission Exhibit No. 345, heretofore identified as the
President's automobile, specify by penciled "X" where you stood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe for the record just what area it is back
there on which you stood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That is a step built into the rear bumper of the automobile, and
on top of the rear trunk there is a handguard which you grab for and hang
onto when you are standing up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are identical objects of those descriptions existing on each
side of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any other occasion en route from Love Field
to downtown Dallas to leave the followup car and mount that portion of
the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I did the same thing approximately four times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What are the standard regulations and practices, if any,
governing such an action on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It is left to the agent's discretion more or less to move to that
particular position when he feels that there is a danger to the President;
to place himself as close to the President or the First Lady as my case was,
as possible, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are those practices specified in any written documents of the
Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; they are not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, had there been any instruction or comment about your
performance of that type of a duty with respect to anything that President
Kennedy himself had said in the period immediately preceding the trip to
Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; there was. The preceding Monday, the President was on a
trip in Tampa, Fla., and he requested that the agents not ride on either of those
two steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And to whom did the President make that request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Assistant Special Agent in Charge Boring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Assistant Special Agent in Charge Boring the individual
in charge of that trip to Florida?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was riding in the Presidential automobile on that trip in
Florida, and I presume that he was. I was not along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, on that occasion would he have been in a position comparable
to that occupied by Special Agent Kellerman on this trip to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; the same position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And Special Agent Boring informed you of that instruction by
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he make it a point to inform other special agents of that
same instruction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I believe that he did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, as a result of what President Kennedy said to him, did
he instruct you to observe that Presidential admonition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How, if at all, did that instruction of President Kennedy affect
your action and&mdash;your action in safeguarding him on this trip to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We did not ride on the rear portions of the automobile. I did on
those four occasions because the motorcycles had to drop back and there was no
protection on the left-hand side of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When the President's automobile was proceeding in downtown
Dallas, what was the ordinary speed of the automobile, based on your best
estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We were running approximately 12 to 15 miles per hour, I would
say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a document which we have marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 354, which is an aerial photograph identical with the photograph
already marked as Commission Exhibit No. 347.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Exhibit No. 354 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I ask you if, referring only to Exhibit 354, you are able to
identify what that scene is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to indicate the route which the President's motorcade
followed through that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what does that scene depict&mdash;what city is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That is Dallas, Tex. It shows Main Street, Houston Street, and
Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you write on the picture itself where Main Street is?
Would you now write, as best you can, which street is Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you now write which street is Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you indicate, if you know, which is a generally
northerly direction on that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. What was the condition of the crowd as the motorcade
made a right-hand turn off of Main Street onto Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The crowd was very large on Main Street, and it was thinning down
considerably when we reached the end of it, and turned right on Houston Street.
Noticeably on my side of the car, which was the left-hand side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your best estimate as to the speed of the President's
car at the time it made the right-hand turn onto Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. In the curve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The speed&mdash;in the curve itself; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We were running generally 12 to 15 miles per hour. I would say
that in the curve we perhaps slowed to maybe 10 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far behind the President's car was the Presidential
followup car as the turn was made onto Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Four to five feet, at the most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a photograph of a building which has already been
marked as Commission Exhibit No. 348, and ask you if at this time you can
identify what that building is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I believe I can, sir; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what building is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It is the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, does that building appear on the Commission Exhibit
No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to notice the Texas School Book
Depository Building as you proceeded in a generally northerly direction on
Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir. It was immediately in front of us and to our left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice anything unusual about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Nothing more unusual than any other building along the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your general practice, if any, in observing such buildings
along the route of a Presidential motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We scan the buildings and look specifically for open windows, for
people hanging out, and there had been, on almost every building along the way,
people hanging out, windows open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you observe, as you recollect at this moment, any open
windows in the Texas School Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to recollect specifically which windows were open
at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; I cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the condition of the crowd along the streets, if any,
along Elm Street, in front of the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. On the left-hand side of the street, which is the side I was on, the
crowd was very thin. And it was a general park area. There were people
scattered throughout the entire park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what is your best estimate of the speed of the President's
automobile as it turned left off of Houston onto Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We were running still 12 to 15 miles per hour, but in the curve I
believe we slowed down maybe to 10, maybe to 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far back of the President's automobile was the Presidential
followup car when the President's followup car had just straightened out on
Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately 5 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as the motorcade proceeded at that point, tell us what
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, as we came out of the curve, and began to straighten up, I
was viewing the area which looked to be a park. There were people scattered
throughout the entire park. And I heard a noise from my right rear, which to
me seemed to be a firecracker. I immediately looked to my right, and, in so
doing, my eyes had to cross the Presidential limousine and I saw President
Kennedy grab at himself and lurch forward and to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why don't you just proceed, in narrative form, to tell us?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. This was the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is the first sound that I heard; yes, sir. I jumped from the
car, realizing that something was wrong, ran to the Presidential limousine. Just
about as I reached it, there was another sound, which was different than the
first sound. I think I described it in my statement as though someone was
shooting a revolver into a hard object&mdash;it seemed to have some type of an
echo. I put my right foot, I believe it was, on the left rear step of the automobile,
and I had a hold of the handgrip with my hand, when the car lurched forward.
I lost my footing and I had to run about three or four more steps before I could
get back up in the car.</p>

<p>Between the time I originally grabbed the handhold and until I was up on
the car, Mrs. Kennedy&mdash;the second noise that I heard had removed a portion of
the President's head, and he had slumped noticeably to his left. Mrs. Kennedy
had jumped up from the seat and was, it appeared to me, reaching for something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
coming off the right rear bumper of the car, the right rear tail, when she noticed
that I was trying to climb on the car. She turned toward me and I grabbed her
and put her back in the back seat, crawled up on top of the back seat and lay
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, referring to Commission Exhibit No. 354, would you mark
an "X", as best you can, at the spot where the President's automobile was at
the time the first shot occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you mark a "Y" at the approximate position where
the President's car was at the second shot you have described? What is your
best estimate of the speed of the President's car at the precise time of the first
shot, Mr. Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We were running between 12 to 15 miles per hour, but no faster
than 15 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many shots have you described that you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear any more than two shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your best estimate of the speed of the President's
automobile at the time of the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately the same speed as that of the first&mdash;although at
the time that I jumped on the car, the car had surged forward. The President
at that time had been shot in the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, in relationship to the second shot, did the car accelerate&mdash;that
is, the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You testified just a moment ago that the President grabbed at
himself immediately after the first noise which you described as sounding like a
firecracker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you tell us with more particularity in what way he
grabbed at himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He grabbed in this general area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are indicating that your right hand is coming up to your&mdash;to
the throat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the left hand crosses right under the right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. To the chest area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To the chest area. Was there any movement of the President's
head or shoulders immediately after the first shot, that you recollect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir. Immediately when I saw him, he was like this, and
going left and forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating a little fall to the left front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. This was after a head wound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Before the head wound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; this was the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what is your best estimate on the timespan between the first
firecracker-type noise you heard and the second shot which you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did the impact on the President's head occur simultaneously,
before, or after the second noise which you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you see the President put his hands to his throat and
chest while you were still on the followup car, or after you had left it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As I was leaving. And that is one of the reasons I jumped, because
I saw him grab himself and pitch forward and to the left. I knew something
was wrong.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It was 5 seconds from the firecracker noise that you
think you got to the automobile?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Until I reached the handhold, had placed my foot on the left rear
step.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, in relationship to the second shot, did Mrs. Kennedy move
out of the rear seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Just after it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say that it appeared that she was reaching as if something
was coming over to the rear portion of the car, back in the area where
you were coming to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anything back there that you observed, that she
might have been reaching for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I thought I saw something come off the back, too, but I cannot
say that there was. I do know that the next day we found the portion of the
President's head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you find that portion of the President's head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It was found in the street. It was turned in, I believe, by a
medical student or somebody in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any difficulty maintaining your balance on the
back of the car after you had come up on the top of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not until we turned off to enter the Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what action did you take specifically with respect to placing
Mrs. Kennedy back in the rear seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I simply just pushed and she moved&mdash;somewhat voluntarily&mdash;right
back into the same seat she was in. The President&mdash;when she had attempted
to get out onto the trunk of the car, his body apparently did not move
too much, because when she got back into the car he was at that time, when I
got on top of the car, face up in her lap.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And that was after she was back in the rear seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where were the President's legs at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Inside the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what, if anything, did you observe as to the condition
of Governor Connally at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. After going under this underpass, I looked forward to the jump
seats, where Mrs. Connally and Governor Connally were sitting. Mrs. Connally
had been leaning over her husband. And I had no idea that he had been
shot. And when she leaned back at one time, I noticed that his coat was unbuttoned,
and that the lower portion of his abdomen was completely covered
with blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was it that you first observed that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Just after going under the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to observe anything which was occurring on the
overpass as the President's motorcade moved toward the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. From the time I got on the back of the Presidential limousine, I
didn't really pay any attention to what was going on outside the automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you noticed the overpass prior to the time you got on the
Presidential automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I had scanned it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you recollect what, if anything, you observed on the
overpass at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There were some people there, but I also noticed there was a
policeman there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how many people would you say were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Very few, I would say&mdash;maybe five, six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how were you able to identify that there was a policeman
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was wearing the uniform&mdash;presumably a policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What color uniform was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think it was blue of some shade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you identify it at that time as being of the identical color
which other Dallas policemen were wearing whom you had observed in the
area?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you characterize the type of acceleration which the car
made after it started to speed forward&mdash;that is, the Presidential car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, the initial surge was quite violent, because it almost jerked
me off the left rear step board. Then after that it was apparently gradual, because
I did not notice it any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the distance from the time of the
shooting to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. In time <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Time and distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Distance, I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would say roughly 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mrs. Kennedy say anything as you were proceeding from
the time of the shooting to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. At the time of the shooting, when I got into the rear of the car,
she said, "My God, they have shot his head off." Between there and the hospital
she just said, "Jack, Jack, what have they done to you," and sobbed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any conversation by anybody else in the President's
automobile from the time of the shooting to the arrival at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I heard Special Agent Kellerman say on the radio, "To the nearest
hospital, quick."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any other comment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He said, "We have been hit."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, was there any other comment you heard Special Agent
Kellerman make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Special Agent Greer say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Connally say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was Governor Connally conscious?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Governor Connally say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did President Kennedy say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate on the speed at which the President's
car traveled from the point of the shooting to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It is a little bit hard for me to judge, since I was lying across the
rear portion of the automobile. I had no trouble staying in that particular position&mdash;until
we approached the hospital, I recall, I believe it was a left-hand
turn and I started slipping off to the right-hand portion of the car. So I would
say that we went 60, maybe 65 at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to secure a handhold or a leg-hold or any sort
of a hold on the automobile as you moved forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir. I had my legs&mdash;I had my body above the rear seat, and
my legs hooked down into the rear seat, one foot outside the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the time of the assassination
itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am not sure whether I asked you about this&mdash;about how long
did it take you to get from the shooting to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Approximately 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to President Kennedy's condition on
arrival at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The right rear portion of his head was missing. It was lying in
the rear seat of the car. His brain was exposed. There was blood and bits of
brain all over the entire rear portion of the car. Mrs. Kennedy was completely
covered with blood. There was so much blood you could not tell if there had
been any other wound or not, except for the one large gaping wound in the
right rear portion of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opportunity to observe the front part of his
body, to see whether there was any tear or rip in the clothing on the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I saw him lying there in the back of the car, when I was immediately
above him. I cannot recall noticing anything that was ripped in the
forward portion of his body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action, if any, did you take to shield the President's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I kept myself above the President and Mrs. Kennedy on the trip to
Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you do anything with your coat upon arrival at Parkland
Hospital to shield the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir. I removed it and covered the President's head and
upper chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you observe as to Governor Connally's
condition on arrival at Parkland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was conscious. There was a large amount of blood in the lower
abdominal area. He was helped from the automobile to the stretcher, and I do
not recall him saying anything, but I know that he was conscious. He was
wheeled immediately into, I think, emergency room No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was removed first from the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long after the President's car arrived at Parkland Hospital
did medical personnel come to the scene to remove the victims?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Seconds. They were there when we were there almost&mdash;almost
simultaneously with the arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know where President Kennedy was taken in the
hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir. I accompanied he, and Mrs. Kennedy to the emergency
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, tell us what you did at the hospital from the time of
arrival on, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I went into the emergency room with the President, but it was so
small, and there were so many people in there that I decided I had better leave
and let the doctors take care of the situation. So I walked outside; asked for
the nearest telephone; walked to the nearest telephone. About that time Special
Agent in Charge Kellerman came outside and said, "Get the White House."</p>

<p>I asked Special Agent Lawson for the local number in Dallas of the White
House switchboard, which he gave to me. I called the switchboard in Dallas;
asked for the line to be open to Washington, and remain open continuously. And
then I asked for Special Agent in Charge Behn's office. Mr. Kellerman came
out of the emergency room about that time, took the telephone and called
Special Agent in Charge Behn that we had had a double tragedy; that both
Governor Connally and President Kennedy had been shot. And that was about
as much as he said. I then took the telephone and shortly thereafter Mr.
Kellerman came out of the emergency room and said, "Clint, tell Jerry this is
unofficial and not for release, but the man is dead." Which I did. During the
two calls, I talked to the Attorney General, who attempted to reach me, and told
him that his brother had been seriously wounded; that we would keep him
advised as to his condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was Mrs. Kennedy all this time, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Immediately upon arrival, she went into the emergency room.
And a few minutes afterward, she was convinced to wait outside, which she did,
remained there the rest of the period of time that we were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was there any pronouncement that the President had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I know of. Apparently there was. I was requested by
Mr. O'Donnell, one of the Presidential assistants, to obtain a casket, because
they wanted to return to Washington immediately. I contacted the administrator
of the hospital and asked him to take me where I could telephone the nearest
mortuary, which I did, requested that their best available casket be brought
to the emergency entrance in my name immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action was taken as a result of that request by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The casket did arrive from the O'Neal Mortuary, Inc., in their own
hearse, which we then wheeled into the emergency room. I left the emergency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
room and asked that two of our agents, Special Agent Sulliman and Assistant
Special Agent in Charge Stout clear all the corridors, and I checked the closest
and most immediate route to the ambulance. We took the body from the
hospital and departed the Parkland Hospital about 2:04 p.m. The ambulance
was driven by Special Agent Berger. Special Agent in Charge Kellerman and
Assistant Special Agent In Charge Stout were riding in the front seat; Mrs.
Kennedy, Dr. Burkley, the President's body, and myself rode in the rear portion
of the ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long did it take you to reach the airplane at
Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We arrived at Love Field at 2:14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you present during the swearing-in ceremonies of
President Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I was aboard the aircraft; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you witness those ceremonies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, the Presidential compartment was so small that not all persons
on the aircraft could get in. I was in the forward portion of the aircraft,
right adjacent to the area that the President was sworn in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the time of the swearing in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. 2:38.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what time did the Presidential aircraft depart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. 2:47.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what time it arrived in the Washington area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. 5:59, I believe, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did it land?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We landed at Andrews Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action, if any, in connection with this matter did you
take following landing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I assisted Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General, who had joined
her at that time, into the ambulance bearing the President's body, and I entered
the automobile immediately behind the ambulance with Dr. John Walsh, Mrs.
Kennedy's physician, and members of President Kennedy's staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Immediately to Bethesda Naval Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you stay with the President's family at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. When we arrived there, I went to the 17th floor with Mrs. Kennedy,
and I remained with Mrs. Kennedy except for one time when I was requested
to come to the morgue to view the President's body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you view the President's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action did you take following the time you viewed the
President's body in the morgue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. After the viewing of the President's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I returned to the 17th floor and remained with Mrs. Kennedy until
we departed the hospital.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. May I ask a question? At the hospital in Texas, you
had seen&mdash;had you seen the whole body, or just the back of the President's head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I had seen the whole body, but he was still cold when I saw him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. At the morgue in Bethesda he was not cold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; the autopsy had been completed, and the Lawler Mortuary
Co. was preparing the body for placement in a casket.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. At this time did you see the whole body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you see any other wound other than the head
wound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I saw an opening in the back, about 6 inches below the
neckline to the right-hand side of the spinal column.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was there a frontal neck injury?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There was an area here that had been opened <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are <span class="locked">indicating&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. In the neck. It was my understanding at that time that this was
done by a tracheotomy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else, if anything, of importance did you do between the
time you viewed the body in the morgue until the termination of your duties on
that date, Mr. Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We handled all communications on the 17th floor, up to the 17th
floor, for Mrs. Kennedy, members of her family, Cabinet members who were
there at that time, and secured the 17th floor for all personnel. No one was
permitted there that we did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you leave the 17th floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I believe, sir, it was 3:56, but I am not sure of the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We went downstairs to the rear of the hospital, where the body was
placed in a naval ambulance. I entered an automobile immediately behind the
ambulance. Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General got into the rear of the
ambulance with the body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And from there, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I accompanied them to the White House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did that mark the termination of your duties for that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir. I remained on duty until approximately 6:30 in the morning;
went home, changed clothes, and came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I believe you testified as to the impression you had as to the
source of the first shot. To be sure that the record is complete, what was your
reaction as to where the first shot came from, Mr. Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you have a reaction or impression as to the source of
point of origin of the second shot that you described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It was right, but I cannot say for sure that it was rear, because
when I mounted the car it was&mdash;it had a different sound, first of all, than the
first sound that I heard. The second one had almost a double sound&mdash;as though
you were standing against something metal and firing into it, and you hear both
the sound of a gun going off and the sound of the cartridge hitting the metal
place, which could have been caused probably by the hard surface of the head.
But I am not sure that that is what caused it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you describing this double sound with respect to what you
heard on the occasion of the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The second shot that I heard; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, do you now or have you ever had the impression or reaction
that there was a shot which originated from the front of the Presidential car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is all I have.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford, any questions you would like to ask?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I have no questions, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Craig.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. If not, thank you very much. We appreciate your coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Youngblood, will you raise your right hand? Do you
solemnly swear the testimony you will give before this Commission will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Be seated, please.</p>

<p>Mr. Specter will conduct the examination.</p>

<h2 id="rwy">TESTIMONY OF RUFUS WAYNE YOUNGBLOOD, SPECIAL AGENT,
SECRET SERVICE</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Rufus Wayne Youngblood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old are you, Mr. Youngblood?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Forty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And by whom are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. The U.S. Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Since March of 1951.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your educational background, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology. Bachelor
of Industrial Engineering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How were you occupied from termination of your college work
until starting with the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I worked for Bradshaws, Inc., which was a refrigeration
and air-conditioning concern in Waycross, Ga., and then worked for Alvin
Lindstrom, who is a consulting mechanical engineer in Atlanta, Ga.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you outline in general terms what your duties have
been with the Secret Service since the time you joined them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I began in the Secret Service as a special agent, criminal
investigator, and started off at the Atlanta field office, and stayed there about
a year and a half. This time was spent in investigation of Government forged
check cases, bond cases, counterfeiting, and similar investigations.</p>

<p>(At this point, Chief Justice Warren withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I came to the Washington, DC. area, and worked in the
Washington field office, a continuation of the same type of work I had done in
Atlanta, plus the beginning of the protective work, working on temporary assignment
at the White House detail. And then in 1953 I was assigned to the
White House detail and worked there during the Eisenhower Administration
about 6 years, and returned to the Atlanta field office for 3 more years in that
area, during which time President Eisenhower would come to Augusta and
Albany, and on two occasions on foreign trips I was called in.</p>

<p>And after 3 years in that field office, I returned to Washington again, assigned
to the White House detail. The last part of the Eisenhower Administration
and the beginning of the Kennedy Administration.</p>

<p>And in March of 1961, I was assigned to the Vice-Presidential detail. This,
at that time, was part of the Washington field office. And I have been on an
assignment with the Vice-Presidential detail since March 1961, except for a 1-month
period when I returned to the White House detail. And then back to the
Vice-Presidential detail.</p>

<p>But during this time, the Vice-Presidential detail changed from a field office
assignment to a small independent office, and then, later, in October of 1962,
when legislation was passed, changing the laws relative to protection of the
Vice President, it became a larger detail. And I have been on the Vice-Presidential
detail in the occurrence at Dallas, and returned to the White House detail
when Mr. Johnson became the President.</p>

<p>And during this period of time, I have been a special agent, assistant special
agent in charge, and was scheduled to be the special agent in charge of the Vice-Presidential
detail. But due to what occurred in Dallas, I went to the White
House as an assistant special agent in charge.</p>

<p>Any other particulars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, what was your rank at the time of the Dallas trip, specifically
on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I was the assistant special agent in charge of the Vice-Presidential
detail.</p>

<p>(At this point, Chief Justice Warren entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And as such, were you responsible for the security of the Vice
President on that trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what is your current rank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Assistant special agent in charge of the White House detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, as such, do you hold one of the three positions of the assistant
special agent in charge at the White House detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that a rank comparable or exactly the same as that now
held by Special Agent Kellerman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; he is senior to me, but it is a comparable rank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you outline briefly and in general terms the activities
of Vice President Johnson during the few days immediately before Friday,
November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. On Tuesday of that week we made a trip from the ranch to
Dallas, and we went by commercial plane&mdash;actually, from the ranch to Austin
in the Vice President's plane, and from Austin to Dallas on a commercial plane.
And while in Dallas, he addressed the Bottlers Convention. And we returned
to the plane, flew back to Austin, then flew back to the ranch later that night,
and remained at the ranch the next day and through Thursday.</p>

<p>And on Thursday we went to San Antonio, to join the group coming down
from Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, when did Vice President Johnson then address the
Bottlers Association in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. That was on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. November 19?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I would have to look at a calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The preceding <span class="locked">Tuesday&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. The preceding Tuesday before the 22d; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, outline in a general way Vice President Johnson's activities
on the morning of November 22d, before he arrived in Dallas, if you
would, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, our day began at the hotel in Fort Worth, where
we had stayed overnight. And that morning we went down to a mezzanine
floor where we met with President Kennedy and a group of White House people.
We went across from this hotel to a parking lot across the street, and they
had a speaker stand there, and they addressed an assembled gathering.</p>

<p>Then they returned to the hotel, and there was a breakfast meeting in the
hotel. They attended that. And, after that, we formed a motorcade and went
to the field nearby in Fort Worth and boarded Air Force 2, and flew into
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately what time did the Vice Presidential plane arrive
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. About 11:35.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you tell the Commission in general terms what Vice
President Johnson did upon arrival at the Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>This plane, Air Force 2, had on board the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson
and other officials. And we disembarked from the plane and were met by a
welcoming committee composed of local dignitaries. And then we moved from
that area where we disembarked over to the area of the ramp, which would
be pushed out when Air Force 1, the President's plane, arrived. And when his
plane did arrive, which was just a few minutes after ours, roughly 10 minutes, we
went out to the foot of the ramp and Vice President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson
headed the reception committee to greet the people who came off of Air
Force 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long did the activities in greeting the crowd
and the general reception last at Love Field on that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Do you mean from the time we arrived on Air Force 2
until we left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I think it was about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, in what position in the motorcade was Vice President
Johnson's automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. We were following the Presidential followup car, and the
motorcade up to our point&mdash;there was a lead car, the President's car, the
Presidential followup car, and then our car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there, to your knowledge, in advance of the lead car a car
known as the pilot car?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; in all probability. This is a normal police
arrangement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you identify the occupants of Vice President Johnson's
car, indicating the positions in the car of each individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. All right, sir. The driver of this car was Hurchel Jacks,
and he is with the State Highway Patrol. And behind him was Senator Ralph
Yarborough, from Texas. And in the middle back seat was Mrs. Johnson. And
on the right-hand side of the back seat, behind me, was the Vice President.
And I was in the front seat on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what kind of an automobile was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. This was a Lincoln convertible, a four-door convertible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is this a specially constructed automobile, or was it obtained
locally for use during this trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. It was obtained locally for use during the trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what car immediately followed the Vice President's
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. The Vice Presidential detail had a followup car which
followed our car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What kind of an automobile was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. It was either a Lincoln or a Mercury, I don't know the
exact make. It was a Ford product, and it was a four-door car. But it was
closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify the occupants of that car, stating where each
sat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. The front seat, the driver, I think his name is Rich. He
is always on the Texas Highway Patrol. In the front seat in the middle is
Cliff Carter. He is an assistant to the Vice President's staff.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Boggs withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. On the right-front side was Jerry Kivett. He is one of
the agents on the Vice Presidential detail. And in the back seat, behind the
driver, was Warren Taylor, and in the back seat on the other side was my
agent, Lem Johns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how many cars there were in the balance of the
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the maximum speed at which the motorcade proceeded
from Love Field down to the downtown area of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I doubt if the motorcade ever exceeded 20 miles or 25 miles
an hour, and most of the time it was going slower than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the minimum speed, would you estimate, during that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. We actually came to stops during this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many stops?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. More than one. Two or more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What occurred during the course of those stops, or what
prompted them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, these stops were made by the Presidential car to greet
well-wishers, students on one particular occasion, and other groups of well-wishers,
that were assembled along the streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Vice President Johnson greet anyone at those stops?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. He did greet them, but he didn't leave the car, I think.
He remained in the car. I got out of the car and stood by the side of it on
more than one occasion. He waved at people, and some did run over, and
I think he did touch some. But he didn't leave the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far behind the President's followup car did the Vice President's
followup car drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. The Vice President's followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Pardon me&mdash;the Vice President's automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. We usually stayed on motorcades like this about two or
three car lengths behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did your distance on this occasion conform to your customary
practice of being that distance behind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the reason, if any, for staying that distance behind
the President's followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, mainly so the crowd can see the Vice President, and
he can see them. If you are too close behind the Presidential group, the crowd
will be watching the President and will watch him as he goes by, and then they
will miss the next man. So it gives the people a chance to recover and look
back and see him, and they to see each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a photograph which has been marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 354, and ask you if you are able to identify what that is a picture of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what does that depict?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, it is a picture showing the main street, Houston Street
and Elm Street, and the assassination occurred on Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you familiar at this time with the identities of Main, Houston,
and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; when I have a map such as this ahead of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. How far behind the President's automobile was the
Vice President's automobile in which you were riding when the Vice President's
automobile turned right off of Main Street onto Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. You ask again how far were we behind the President's
car? Did you mean, sir, how far were we behind the Presidential followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; I meant the President's car on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, we were a distance of about two car lengths behind
the followup car, and they were probably one car length behind the Presidential
car. But this would be a guess on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the situation with respect to the crowd which was
lined up on Houston and Elm as you approached that intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. On Houston Street, on the side where the tall building is,
the crowd was still somewhat continuous. On the side which is the park side,
the crowd was smaller. They did have some people there, but it wasn't continuous
in the same way it was on the building side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the speed of the Vice President's
car as you proceeded down Houston Street toward Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, our speed, of course, was governed by the vehicles in
front of us, but I would say we had just made one turn, and it was only a block
there before we would make another turn. It was approximately 10 miles an
hour, between 10 and 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a photograph which has been marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 348, and I ask you if you are now able to identify what that
building is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; I am now able to identify it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is that building, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. That is the School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where, as best you can recollect, was the Vice President's car
at the time the first shots were heard? And would you take Commission Exhibit
No. 354 and take the red pencil and mark as closely as you can the exact position
on Commission Exhibit 354 of the Vice President's car with the capital letter
"A" there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. At the time of the first shot, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. It will be in this area here, I should think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I want the Vice President's car at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, this is what I am attempting to locate. It would
be in the vicinity of this "X" right here, I do believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now, will you <span class="locked">describe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Excuse me. You said put an "A" here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, please. Will you describe just what occurred as the motorcade
proceeded past the intersection of Houston and Elm Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, the crowd had begun to diminish, looking ahead and
to the right the crowd became spotty. I mean it wasn't continuous at all, like
it had been. As we were beginning to go down this incline, all of a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
there was an explosive noise. I quickly observed unnatural movement of
crowds, like ducking or scattering, and quick movements in the Presidential
followup car. So I turned around and hit the Vice President on the shoulder
and hollered, get down, and then looked around again and saw more of this
movement, and so I proceeded to go to the back seat and get on top of him.</p>

<p>I then heard two more shots. But I would like to say this. I would not be
positive that I was back on that back seat before the second shot. But the
Vice President himself said I was. But&mdash;then in hearing these two more shots,
I again had seen more movement, and I think someone else hit a siren&mdash;I heard
the noise of a siren.</p>

<p>I told the driver to close it up, and stick close to that car in front. And
right away we started a hasty evacuation speed, and left this immediate area,
and we were following close behind. And I had a radio which was on a Baker
frequency, where I could communicate back with the agents in my followup car.
And they had a Charlie frequency, which was on the same network of the Presidential
motorcade. And I called back and said I am switching to Baker frequency&mdash;I
said, "I am switching to Charlie." And as I switched, I heard some
transmission over the Charlie sets saying for me to keep my man covered, and
I heard Kivett reply to Emory Roberts that he was covered, and I saw agents
in the followup car, the Presidential followup car signaling us to stay close. I
asked the driver what his opinion was as to&mdash;I don't know for exact sure just
where we were going, but I knew our best protection was to stay with that
Presidential followup crew. And I asked the driver if he had passed the Trade
Mart. He said he passed it and we were going on to the hospital. And I heard
indications over the radio that we were going to the hospital. We had a very
fast ride there.</p>

<p>I told the driver to go as fast as he could without having a wreck. There
was some conversation between the Vice President and myself while we were
going to the hospital. I told him that I didn't know how serious it was up in
the front car, but when we arrived at the hospital, I would like to get out of
the car and go into the building and not stop, and for him to stay close to
myself and the other agents. He agreed to.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the hospital, we immediately went right in. As we
stopped at the hospital, two of my agents from the Vice Presidential car, followup
car, were coming up to meet us, and two from the Presidential followup were
coming to meet us, and, with this group, we proceeded into the hospital and
then went into a room. I posted one man at the door and said, not to let anyone
in unless he knew him, was certain of his identity.</p>

<p>I told Jerry Kivett and Warren Taylor to pull all the shades and blinds, which
they did. And they also busied themselves with evacuating a couple of people
out of there. There was a nurse and a patient in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before you go on, Mr. Youngblood, let me drop back and pick
up a few of the details theretofore.</p>

<p>What would your best estimate be of the speed of the Vice President's car
at the time you heard that first explosive noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Oh, approximately 12 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And had you maintained the distance which you have described
heretofore behind the President's followup car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, generally. Sometimes as we went around corners, we
tried to close up the gap a little bit. But as soon as we got on a straight stretch,
we would drop back two or three car lengths.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, at this particular time, what is your best recollection of
the distance between the Presidential followup car and the Vice President's
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. We are on Elm Street now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the time the first shot occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. We were two or three car lengths behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far behind the President's car was the Presidential
followup car at the time of the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I would think somewhat less than a car length.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the total timespan between the
first and third shots which you have already described?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. From the beginning to the last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I would think 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you have described the first shot as being an explosive noise.
How would you describe each of the second and third shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, there wasn't too much difference in the noise of the
first shot and the last two. I am not really sure that there was a difference.
But in my mind, I think I identified the last two positively as shots, whereas
the first one I thought was just an explosive noise, and I didn't know whether
it was a firecracker or a shot. It seems, as I try to think over it, there was
more of a crack sound to the last two shots. That may have been distance, I
don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as to time interval&mdash;was there longer or less time or the
same between the first and second shots and the second and third shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. There seemed to be a longer span of time between the first
and the second shot than there was between the second and third shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you have any reaction or impression as to the source
or point of origin of the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I didn't know where the source or the point of origin was, of
course, but the sounds all came to my right and rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, how about as to the latter two shots, would the same apply,
or would there be a different situation there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. No; all of them seemed to sound that they were from the
right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did they sound on the surface or in the air or couldn't
you discern?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I couldn't say for certain. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you then or have you ever had any contrary impression
that the shots might have come from in front as opposed to the rear of the
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you say that you hit the Vice President's shoulder, and at
that time you were indicating your left hand, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which hand did you use in hitting the Vice President's shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. My left, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And which shoulder of the Vice President did you hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. His right, because I turned this way. I turned to my left,
with the hand out, and then came into his right shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you moved from the front to the rear seat, would you
describe in as much detail as you can your relative position with respect to the
position of President Johnson's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, the Vice President says that I vaulted over. It was
more of a stepping over. And then I sat on top of him, he being crouched down
somewhat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating towards the left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. He moved towards the center, or towards his left, yes, sir, and
down. And then I sat on this portion of his arm here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the right upper portion of the arm from elbow to the
shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were the positions of the other occupants of the back
seat at the time you sat on the Vice President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Mrs. Johnson more or less moved into a forward&mdash;just moved
forward. And Senator Yarborough also moved forward, and possibly he moved
over a little to the right. I am not sure. But we were all below the window
level of the car. And those two generally were forward. But the Vice President
was forward and a little to his left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what direction did you look when you were first sitting on
the Vice President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. In what direction did I look?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Almost all directions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have a reaction with respect to looking in the direction
from which you thought the danger was emanating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I think I first looked to the right&mdash;but to the right, forward,
up, as much as I could scan, and also the people in the Presidential followup car.
Because I recall seeing at the time one of our agents, Hickey, who was in the
Presidential followup car, in almost a standing position with an AR-15 looking
back and up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to fix the precise time of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I would say 12:30. I was to keep the times. The Vice
President was asking me if we were running on time, and so forth. And so he
asked me how much further, and I would call back to our followup car and
ask them how many more miles and so forth.</p>

<p>So, for this reason, I was at that time keeping up with the time very closely.
And when we turned the corner, I noticed an illuminated clock sign on this
building, which I now know is the School Book Depository Building. And that
clock indicated 12:30. And the reason it is significant is because this was the
time we were supposed to arrive at the Trade Mart.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As you looked at the school depository building, and
noticed this clock, where is the clock? Can you identify it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. This, right here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is on top of the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; right up here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And this is after you turned from Main Street on to
Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. We were on Houston Street&mdash;just as soon as we got on Houston
Street. And I looked up and I saw it there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you notice anything else on the building as you
scanned it from the top down, or from the bottom up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I noticed open windows, and some people, I think. But I
didn't notice this particular window.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You saw nothing unusual in any of the open windows
that you noticed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, sir, all through the day here we had been passing
buildings with windows and people. And that I saw. But I saw nothing
unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Youngblood, what is your best estimate as to the time it
took to get to Parkland Hospital after the shooting occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I believe it was between 5 and 8 minutes, something of that
nature.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what speed did your automobile proceed, based on your
best estimate, en route from the shooting to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I believe we were going around 60 or 70 miles an hour at
times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you observe President Kennedy or Governor Connally
being removed from the President's automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. No, sir; because I had&mdash;as I mentioned before&mdash;I had told
the Vice President, or suggested to the Vice President that we did not want
to linger, and get into the building as quickly as we could, and we would find
out the condition of the other party after we got into a safe place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had they already been taken in by the time you arrived at the
scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. No, sir; I don't hardly see how they could have been, because
we arrived almost simultaneously with them. It was just a matter of
opening the door and getting out of the car and hastily walking right on past.
I think they were in the act of removing these people, but I don't think they
would have had time to have removed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you enter the emergency entrance as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, I interrupted you before when you were describing the
security arrangements which you were making on the room to which you took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the Vice President. Would you continue and describe for us what occurred
thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. At what point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I interrupted you. You were in the room, you had pulled the
shades down, and were making security arrangements for the Vice President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, we were in a corner of this room, and there was the
Vice President, Mrs. Johnson, and myself at first, with agents Kivett and Warren
Taylor also in the big room, but not right over in the corner at the beginning.
And shortly thereafter Emory Roberts came in. He was one of the White
House detail agents. He told us that the situation&mdash;situation with President
Kennedy looked very bad. The Vice President asked me what I thought&mdash;what
we should do. And I said I think we should evacuate the hospital as soon as
we can, and get on the plane, and return to Washington. And Emory Roberts
concurred. And the Vice President agreed. But he wanted to get a better
report on the condition and so forth.</p>

<p>Then we were joined by many others. Congressman Homer Thornberry
came in, and Congressman Brooks, and Cliff Carter, and the Vice President had
some conversations with these gentlemen. And at one time Cliff went out and
got coffee. And then Mr. Ken O'Donnell and Roy Kellerman came down on
one occasion, and Ken O'Donnell said for us to return to Washington, and to go
ahead and take the President's plane.</p>

<p>The Vice President was worried about Mrs. Kennedy. So Mrs. Johnson thought
that she would go see Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally. She did. Agents
Kivett and Taylor went with her. Then later, after she came back, Ken O'Donnell
and Roy Kellerman came down again and told us that the President had
died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time was that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I don't know. I had told Lem Johns to try to keep up with
all the times. I think it is a matter of record. I believe you have it in other
documents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, are you referring to a document which I will mark as
Commission Exhibit 355?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 355 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. This is our shift report, and this is the times that Lem Johns
was keeping that day. He shows 1 p.m., President Kennedy died at Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that daily shift report prepared under your supervision,
Mr. Youngblood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you review it and approve it when it was completed, after
the end of the workday on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, not exactly at the end of the workday, sir. These
agents would keep notes. And in this particular case you can see that this one,
it says, "Date completed, December 2" down at the bottom. That is when he
got around to typing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, does this document bear your initial in any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; up at the top. The "RYW" is my initials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And does that signify your approval shortly after completion
of the document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Would you go ahead and tell us what your activities
were from the time you had learned that the President had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, when Mr. O'Donnell and Roy Kellerman told us that
he had died, the Vice President said, "Well, how about Mrs. Kennedy?"</p>

<p>O'Donnell told the Vice President that Mrs. Kennedy would not leave the
hospital without the President's body. And O'Donnell suggested we go to the
plane and that they just come on the other plane. And I might add that, as a
word of explanation, there were two jet planes, one Air Force 1, in which the
President flew, and the other Air Force 2, in which the Vice President and his
party flew on. And O'Donnell told us to go ahead and take Air Force 1. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
believe this is mainly because Air Force 1 has better communications equipment
and so forth than the other planes.</p>

<p>President Johnson said that he didn't want to go off and leave Mrs. Kennedy
in such a state. And so he agreed that we would go on to the airplane and board
the plane and wait until Mrs. Kennedy and the body would come out. Shall I
go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. Proceed. Did you then depart from Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir; previous to all of this, I had Johns, my agent, line
up some unmarked police cars so that they would be ready when we did decide
to evacuate the hospital.</p>

<p>So we left the room and proceeded out to these cars. The car that we went in
was driven by Chief Curry, the Dallas Police Chief, and Congressman Thornberry
was in the front seat, and the Vice President and I were in the back
seat. And I had told the Vice President before we left the room that I would
prefer that he stay below window level, and stay close with me as we went out,
and that I would also prefer Mrs. Johnson to go in another car, but she would
be accompanied by agents. And Mrs. Johnson did get in a second car. She
was accompanied by Warren Taylor and Jerry Kivett and Congressman Brooks,
and also Glen Bennett, another agent from the White House.</p>

<p>And as we started to leave the hospital area, that is drive away, just as we
started away, Congressman Thomas saw us leaving&mdash;I imagine he saw Congressman
Thornberry, and he said, "Wait for me." I don't think he saw the Vice
President. And I told the driver to continue. I didn't want to stop there in
front of the hospital. But by this time Congressman Thomas was right over
at the side of the car, and the Vice President said, "Stop and let him get in."</p>

<p>So he got in in the front seat with Congressman Thornberry, having Congressman
Thornberry move over closer to the driver. And then we started out again.
This probably takes longer to tell about it than it actually took. It was about
a 30-second stop.</p>

<p>We started out again, and the Vice President asked Congressman Thornberry
to climb on over and get in the back seat, which he did, while the car was in
motion. And then that put Congressman Thornberry behind the driver, and on
the Vice President's left, and I was on his right.</p>

<p>And we continued on our way. We were momentarily stopped as we were
leaving the hospital on this access road. There was a truck or delivery or something
coming in there. We were stopped for one moment. But then the police
got us on through, and we went on out to the main roads, and we were getting a
motorcycle escort.</p>

<p>And they started using the sirens, and the Vice President and I both asked
Chief Curry to discontinue the use of sirens, that we didn't want to attract
attention. We were going on an unscheduled different route. We were not
using any particular route. But in telling Lem Johns to get a car available, I
told him to be sure and get a local driver who knew the area, a local policeman
who could take us any route that we needed to go, and knew all the areas of
evacuation and so forth.</p>

<p>So we went on to the airport. But we did have him stop using the sirens.
And just before arriving at the airport, I called on the radio and told Air Force
1 to be ready to receive us, that we would be coming on board immediately.
We arrived there and ran up the ramp onto the plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long after that did the swearing-in ceremonies occur?
Approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I would say in the neighborhood of about 40 or 45 minutes
after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long after the arrival of the Vice President on the plane
did the party of the late President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy arrive at the
plane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Approximately&mdash;after we got on the plane, I would say it
was approximately 30 or 35 minutes before Mrs. Kennedy and that party
arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long after the swearing-in ceremonies did the plane
take off for the Washington area?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. After the swearing-in ceremonies, it took off immediately.
It was just a matter of letting the people who had to get off the plane, such as
Judge Hughes and Chief Curry disembark, and as soon as they had disembarked,
we closed the door and started taxiing out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any conversations between Vice President Johnson
and anyone else with respect to advice on the swearing-in ceremonies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir. I think probably the first thing the Vice President
did after he got on board the plane was to place a call to the Attorney General.
In fact, he talked to the Attorney General, I believe, two times&mdash;at least two
times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present when those conversations occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I was present when he placed the first call. I think he
placed the first call from the bedroom there of the plane. Then someone from
the Attorney General's office called back&mdash;not the Attorney General, but someone
from the office&mdash;and gave the wording of the oath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you informed as to what advice Vice President Johnson
received from Mr. Kennedy with respect to the time of swearing in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. I heard him discussing this&mdash;because after we got on board
the plane I told them to pull down the shades, and then I told the Vice President,
I am going to stick with you like glue while we are on the ground here. And
so we were joined by Mrs. Johnson and then by Congressman Thornberry and
Thomas, and Congressman Brooks. And I heard them discussing about taking
the oath immediately, right there in Dallas. I heard the Vice President ask
about anyone in particular that should administer the oath. And as I gathered
from conversation, it was anyone who was authorized to administer a Federal
oath. And then he put in calls to Judge Hughes, and he told me to expect
Judge Hughes and to be sure she could get through the security lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, were you informed that Attorney General Kennedy advised
Vice President Johnson that he should have himself sworn in as promptly as
possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, as I said, I was in the area, in their immediate
vicinity, when they were talking about it. And this is what I gathered from
hearing them talk&mdash;that the Attorney General had told him to go ahead and
be sworn in there, as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And upon arrival back in Andrews Air Force Base, what activity,
if any, were you engaged in then, along with President Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Well, on the plane, on the flight up here, there had been
numerous radio contacts in making arrangements and so forth. But when we
actually arrived, Mrs. Kennedy and the body were removed first by the lift
that was provided, and then when the ramp was in place, our party disembarked
from the plane, and then President Johnson had a short statement
that he was to make, and we went over to an area where the microphones
were set up, and he made this brief statement. And then we proceeded from
there to the awaiting helicopter, which was just a few yards away. We
boarded the helicopter and flew in to the south grounds of the White House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you then accompany President Johnson to his home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. He didn't go to his home at that time; but the answer
to your question is yes, when he did go later that night. You see, he went
to his office in the EOB, the Executive Office Building, and conducted business
there until in the vicinity of 9 o'clock. And then he went home, at which time
I accompanied him, and many other agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe briefly what security arrangements if any
were instituted on that day for the Vice President's daughters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Youngblood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>While we were in the hospital, receiving these reports relative to President
Kennedy's condition, I asked Mrs. Johnson&mdash;I knew generally where Luci
and Lynda were, but I wanted to get the very latest from her, since sometimes
these girls might visit a friend or a relative. And I knew that Lynda was
going to the University of Texas, and that Luci was going to National Cathedral.
So I confirmed the locations with Mrs. Johnson and then told Agent Kivett, who
was in our presence at the time I was talking to her, to make the necessary calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
to have Secret Service protection placed around Lynda and Luci. And Agent
Kivett made these calls and then came back and reported to me that Lockwood,
from Austin, who is in the San Antonio office, but he was in Austin at the time,
had proceeded to the University of Texas to get Lynda, and that an agent from
the Washington field office would go out and get Luci at the school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I move for the admission into evidence of
Commission Exhibits No. 354, which is a reproduction of the overhead shot,
and 355, which is a reproduction of the Vice Presidential detail schedules.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 354 and 355, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That concludes my questions, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Craig, any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>. I have no questions, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Agent Youngblood, thank you very much for coming
and testifying. We appreciate it.</p>

<p>We will adjourn now. We will adjourn until 9 in the morning.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 6:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Since August of 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline for us <span class="locked">briefly&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. 1950 or 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline for us briefly your educational background,
please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I attended Highland Park High School and then Southern
Methodist University, where I studied for a business degree, and I did not
finish. I lack about 8 hours of finishing, of getting a degree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What year did you leave the university?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How were you occupied between the time you left the university
and the time you started to work for the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I did some freelance photography work for a while, over a
year, until I went into the service on the 6 month's plan through my National
Guard unit, and I was a photographer there in the Army, on-the-job training,
and then after I was released from the Army I did freelance work, I guess
for about a year, until I got the job at the Herald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old are you at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Twenty-nine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your marital status?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I am married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. One child. One girl 15 months today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going back to November 22, 1963, by whom were you employed
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Dallas Times Herald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your assignment on that specific day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I was assigned to the motorcade to meet the President, Love
Field, and go to the Trade Mart and that was the extent of it, cover the
parade, I mean the motorcade and the speech.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you assigned to take pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. To take pictures, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you meet the President at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you take photographs for your newspaper at Love
Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe briefly your activities at Love Field on the morning of
November 22, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, we got there, I guess, 30, 40 minutes early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time would that have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I have to think to remember exactly what time, around 9, I
guess, 9 to 9:15, I believe. And I took pictures there. There were other photographers
from our paper there, our chief photographer. And we just took
shots of the crowd, and waited for the President to arrive.</p>

<p>And then when he did arrive, our chief photographer left and went directly
to the Trade Mart and I got into the motorcade to ride to town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know exactly which car you were in in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. We counted up, and it is either the seventh or eighth car. We
said eighth car from the President, from the lead car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say we counted up, whom do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The photographers in the car. As we left Love Field, we were
trying to figure how far back we were and we all decided it was the eighth car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you reconstruct that count for us which provided the basis
for your conclusion that you were in the seventh or eighth car. For example,
how many cars ahead of you was the President's car or the Vice President's car,
if you can recollect, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Let me think a minute. I know there was a photographer's
car directly in front of us which I believe had some of the local press. It was
a convertible. Then in front were, I believe, two or three cars carrying the
press, the White House press, and then President Johnson, I guess would be
in the next car, and then the President in the lead car, or the next car, and I
believe there was another car in the lead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So as you recollect the scene there was the lead and immediately
behind the lead car, whose car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The President's, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And then immediately behind the President's whose car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The Vice President's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And immediately to the rear of the Vice President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Press vehicles and I was told it was the White House press, two
or three cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And then there was one car filled with photographers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Directly in front of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Between your car and the cars which you believe to have been
filled with White House newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Wasn't there a Secret Service car directly behind the President's
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Between it and the Vice President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Wasn't there a Secret Service car immediately behind the Vice
President's car, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. There must have been. That is what I can't recall is which
was which in there. I knew the White House press was in there but I didn't
know how many cars. I am sure there were Secret Service cars, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you were proceeding along in the motorcade, were you
within sight of the President's automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. At times. When he was&mdash;when we could not get a clear view
of it because of the photographers in the car ahead of us who were sitting
up on the back of the seat just like we were, we did not have a clear view of the
car at all times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you proceeded along approximately how far behind the
President's car were you, expressed either in cars, block lengths or in any way
that is convenient for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, I would say approximately a block, average city block,
maybe closer at times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Jackson, I show you a photograph which has been marked
heretofore as Commission Exhibit No. 347, and ask you to look at it for a
moment, and see if you can identify what that photograph depicts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; this is the scene of the assassination, parade route,
Main and Houston, left on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, which street did the Presidential motorcade take coming
on to that scene which you have described as the assassination scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. They were on Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And before Houston what street were they on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What direction were they proceeding on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now without reference to the photograph, will you tell us what
happened as the motorcade proceeded west on Main Street?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, on Main, as we neared Houston Street everyone was
more or less in a relaxed state in our car, because we were near the end of the
route, I guess, nothing unusual happened on Main Street.</p>

<p>The final block on Main, before we turned on Houston I was in the process
of unloading a camera and I was to toss it out of the car as we turned right on
Houston Street to one of our reporters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had that been set up by prearrangement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir. And that I did as we turned the corner, and when&mdash;it
was in an interval and as I threw it out the wind blew it, caught it and
blew it out into the street and our reporter chased it out into the street and
the photographers in our car, one of the photographers, was a TV cameraman
whom I do not recall his name, and he was joking about the film being thrown
out and he was shooting my picture of throwing the film out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At this point could you tell us, to the best of your recollection,
precisely who was with you in the car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Jim Underwood from KRLD-TV station, Tom Dillard, chief
photographer for the Dallas Morning News, and me, and then two newsreel
cameramen who I know by sight but I don't know their names.</p>

<p>One is with WFAA which is the Dallas Morning News station, and I believe
the other was channel 11, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you position those people in the automobile for us with
respect to where each was sitting?</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Tom Dillard and Jim Underwood were in the front seat with
the driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify who the driver was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But he was a sixth individual separate and apart from the five
heretofore described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir. And in the back seat were the two I know by sight
but I can't remember the names.</p>

<p>And I was on the right side of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the right side of which seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Back seat, sitting up on the back of a seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What kind of a car was it, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I believe it was a Chevrolet convertible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Top down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you carrying one camera or more than one camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Two cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was one camera loaded at the time you rounded the corner
of Main and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; and one was empty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it from the camera which was empty that you had taken
the roll of film which you have just described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Will you now proceed to tell us what happened as
you rounded the corner of Main and Houston, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, as our reporter chased the film out into the street, we
all looked back at him and were laughing, and it was approximately that time
that we heard the first shot, and we had already rounded the corner, of course,
when we heard the first shot. We were approximately almost half a block on
Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you identify for me on Commission Exhibit 347, precisely
as possible, where your automobile was at the time you heard the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Approximately right here, I would say the midpoint of this
building. Approximately where we heard the first report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you mark in a black "X" on 347 the spot where your
car was at the time you heard the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Right here approximately. And as we heard the first shot, I
believe it was Tom Dillard from Dallas News who made some remark as to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
sounding like a firecracker, and it could have been somebody else who said that.
But someone else did speak up and make that comment and before he actually
finished the sentence we heard the other two shots. Then we realized or we
thought that it was gunfire, and then we could not at that point see the President's
car. We were still moving slowly, and after the third shot the second
two shots seemed much closer together than the first shot, than they were to the
first shot. Then after the last shot, I guess all of us were just looking all around
and I just looked straight up ahead of me which would have been looking at
the School Book Depository and I noticed two Negro men in a window straining
to see directly above them, and my eyes followed right on up to the window above
them and I saw the rifle or what looked like a rifle approximately half of the
weapon, I guess I saw, and just as I looked at it, it was drawn fairly slowly
back into the building, and I saw no one in the window with it.</p>

<p>I didn't even see a form in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I said "There is the gun," or it came from that window. I
tried to point it out. But by the time the other people looked up, of course,
it was gone, and about that time we were beginning to turn the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which corner were you beginning to turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Houston onto Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now show you a photograph marked as Commission Exhibit
No. 348 and ask you if you can identify what that depicts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. This is the School Book Depository. This is the window the
two colored men were looking out of. This is the window where the rifle was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark the window where the rifle was with an "A" and
would you please mark the window where you have identified the men below with
a "B."</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Referring to your mark of "A," the photograph will show that
you have marked the window on the sixth floor with the mark being placed on
the window on the westerly half of the first double window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I am sorry. This window here on the very end was the
window where the weapon was. I am sorry, I just marked the double&mdash;actually
this is the rifle window right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you take the black pencil again and draw an arrow&mdash;before
you start to mark, hear the rest of the question&mdash;as precisely as you
can to the exact spot where you saw what you have described as the rifle.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the window you have just marked as being the spot from
which the rifle protruded, open when you looked up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best recollection as to how far open it was at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I would say that it was open like that window there, halfway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating a window on the sixth floor of the westernmost
portion of the building open halfway as you have described it.</p>

<p>My last comment, as to the description of your last window, is only for the
purpose of what you have said in identifying a window to show how far open
the window was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which you heretofore marked with an arrow, correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Also in that window I could see boxes, corrugated boxes on the left portion
which would be my left, of the window, of the open window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many boxes could you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I couldn't tell. It just seemed like a stack of boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How high were the boxes stacked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Maybe two is all I saw. They were stacked, I believe they
were as high as the window was open, halfway up the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best recollection of the size of those boxes which
you say you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Maybe like that, that wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating approximately 3 feet wide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Three feet or a little less maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the height of those boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I would say high enough to hide a man. Let's say, between 5
and 6 feet high, I would say to the best of my recollection. From the angle I
was looking at it, I would say they were 5 feet high at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is each box would be 5 feet high?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No; the stack, the stacked boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you see how many boxes were stacked up to reach a
total height of 5 to 6 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you able to see anyone in front of those boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whether or not you could identify anyone, could you see even
the form or outline of the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir. It looked to me like the man was over to the side
of the window because the rifle was at quite an angle to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which side of the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, from the position of the rifle it would be the corner
of the building, the east. It would be to the right of the window from my
view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which direction was the rifle pointing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. West. To my left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it pointing in a straight westerly direction or was it pointing
at an angle from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. It was at an angle from the building. I am not&mdash;well, let's
see&mdash;well, it wouldn't be directly west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the general line of direction of the pointing of the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, directly down the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And by down the street you are pointing out what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Down Elm Street toward the triple, toward the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it pointed as you have indicated at the angle which Elm
Street traverses heading toward the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir. And the rifle was pointing slightly down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you at any time in this sequence observe the President's
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. As we turned the corner&mdash;or we stopped where the intersection,
actually we stopped before we began to turn left onto Elm Street, or
rather I would say we hesitated and we were all looking down towards the
President's car and I could see two cars going under the underpass. I barely
saw the President's car. I would say just the rear end of it as it disappeared
under the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that the only time you saw the President's car from
the time you made a right-hand turn off of Main Street onto Houston
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the time span between
the first shot you heard and the last shot you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I would say 5 to 8 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give us a breakdown between the shots which you
heard as to how many seconds elapsed between each one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I would say to me it seemed like 3 or 4 seconds between the
first and the second, and between the second and third, well, I guess 2 seconds,
they were very close together. It could have been more time between
the first and second. I really can't be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you sure you heard three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you mark on the overhead shot, which is Exhibit
347, with a "Y" as precisely as you can the position of your automobile at
the time you heard the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. With a "Y"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, please.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you now mark on the same exhibit the precise position
of your car as closely as you can recollect it when you heard the third
shot with a letter "Z"?</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, in relation to the timing of the shots, which you have
described, did you first look toward the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. It couldn't have been more than 3 seconds before I looked
at that window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Three seconds from what point in time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. From the last shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you say from the last shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. From the last shot, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best recollection or estimate of the speed of
your automobile as you were proceeding in a generally northerly direction
on Houston Street at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I would say not over 15 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would your best estimate be as to the minimum speed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Ten, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where, in the window were the two Negro men, whom you
have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Well, there was one in each of those double windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On which floor was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you place an arrow where you saw each of those
men, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Each one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any reaction from either or both of those
two men when you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir. Just looking up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you see their faces reasonably clearly to observe that
they were looking up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I could tell they were looking up because they were leaning
way out just like that. I couldn't see their faces very well at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The witness has leaned forward and turned his head to the
right and looking upward as he sits in the witness chair, may the record
show.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did they both turn the same way as you have indicated
in answer to Mr. Specter's question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. To the best of my recollection one man looked up to his
right and the other man looked up like this to his left, one in each window.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you identify which to his right and which to
his left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I believe the one on the right window, my right, was looking
to his right. The one on the west window, the one to my left was looking
to his left. I believe I am right on that but I may not be because I just
looked at them for a fraction of a second, I just followed them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the distance which separated
you from those two men at the time you observed them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I am not very good at distances. I was about the middle
of the block, I guess. I would say around a hundred yards, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see those two men before or after you observed the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of how many inches of the rifle
that you observed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I saw the barrel and about half&mdash;well, I did not see a telescopic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
sight, but I did see part of the stock, so I guess maybe 8 or 10 inches
of the stock maybe. I did see part of the stock, I did not see the sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Eight or ten inches of the stock, and how much of the barrel
would you estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I guess possibly a foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anyone's hands on the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as best as you can recollect it, what exact words did
you state at or about the time you made the observation of the rifle, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I said, "There is the gun" and somebody said "Where?"
And I said, "It came from that window" and I pointed to that window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect who it was who said "Where?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Somebody in the car, I don't recall who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anybody else in the car say anything else at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Nothing that I could remember. I am sure they were all
talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you say anything else at about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. If I did, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anyone in the automobile state that he, too, had seen the rifle
from the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have a conversation with all of the men in the car immediately
after the incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir; because as, I guess after the third shot, I do recall the
driver speeding up, and we hesitated at the corner before turning left, and three
of the occupants of the car got out, jumped out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who were those three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. That was Underwood, Jim Underwood, Tom Dillard and one of
the TV cameramen. The WHAA channel 8 cameraman and I were left in the
back seat. We couldn't make up our minds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there an individual in the car by the name of Mr. Couch,
to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Couch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I don't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Malcolm Couch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The name is familiar. I might state what I did see as we did
hesitate there, at the corner, I don't recall whether this was before the other
three fellows got out of the car or not, I believe we were still all in the car,
as we observed these other things, but in a fleeting glance as I saw the cars go
under the underpass, I did see people running. I saw a motorcycle policeman
jump off his motorcycle, in fact, he just hit the curb and just let it fall, and he
went down on his knees on the grass, on the lawn of that parkway.</p>

<p>I did see a family covering up their child, and I just saw a state of confusion,
people running, and that is about all I saw at that point of the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Jackson, at the time you heard the first shot, did you have
any reaction or impression from the sound itself as to the source of the shot,
point of origin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir; I didn't. It did sound like it came from ahead of us
or from that general vicinity but I could not tell whether it was high up or on
the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say that general vicinity, what vicinity did you
mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. We were sure it came from ahead of us which would be in a
northerly direction, northwesterly direction. It did sound as though it came
from somewhere around the head of the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the second shot, did you have any reaction or impression
as to the source of this shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir. Through all three shots, I could just tell that it was
ahead of me and not behind me, that is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the same impression then prevailed through the third shot
as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir. To me it never sounded like it was high or low.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had occasion since this incident to relate the factual
sequences, your observations and what you heard? Have you had occasion to
tell anybody about what you saw and heard as you have described it to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has there been any variation in your recollection or impressions
about your observations on these occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Not to my knowledge. The other times were not as thorough
as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, those are all of the questions which I have,
sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford, any questions you would like to ask Mr.
Jackson?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Jackson, when and by whom were you questioned
or interrogated subsequent to the event? I was thinking of the FBI, the Secret
Service, or any investigative organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. You say when, how soon afterwards?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I would say within 2 days afterwards, let's see, the next day
was the first day.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Saturday November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir; I believe it was the first time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who, by name, if you can, but if not by what organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. The FBI called me, I believe it was Friday evening, and I
believe I did give some information on the phone Friday night.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was that followed <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. And they came and saw me in the office, I believe on Saturday.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How did they happen to contact you? Had you made
a statement publicly before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Our newspaper ran an article by me or I got a byline on it
stating this in general which I have stated today.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Following this initial contact have you made subsequent
statements to various organizations or any organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I made statements to the Secret Service also. Other than that
there was none other.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How good are your eyes, do you wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you had an eye examination recently or when was
the last examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I had a physical when I reenlisted in the National Guard, let's
see, that was, I believe, about a year and a half ago, I had that physical and
I had 20&ndash;20 vision.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. 20&ndash;20 vision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You just indicated you were in the Texas National
Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How long have you been in the Texas National Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I joined in October 1958.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you have been in continuously since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So you are familiar with guns in general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So you would readily identify, if you saw it, a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did any others in the automobile in which you were
riding recollect as far as you know, hearing you say "There is the gun."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I don't know whether they would remember it or not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you ever talked with any others in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I have never sat down and talked with them about the events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
no, sir. I have seen them, of course, several times but I have never discussed
it with them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You never discussed what you said or what they said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir. I guess the one man I have discussed it more with than
anybody else was Tom Dillard, the chief photographer for the Dallas News,
and we recalled to each other the scene but we really never went into any detail
or as to what each one of us said either.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At the time you were in the car, after it had turned
from Main onto Houston, was there any noise from the crowd on either side
of the street, Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. There was very little crowd on Houston, as I recall. On Houston
itself. The crowd&mdash;I mean as compared to Main Street, to the other end of
town and down through Main. The crowd thinned out as we got down near
the intersection of Main and Houston, and there were a lot less people but
I couldn't make an estimate of how many.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was no noise from the crowd at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir; no noise, I would say.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At the time you heard the first shot, what was your position
in the car? Were you standing or sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I was sitting on the back of the seat, on the right-hand side of
the back seat, sitting up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you have your camera in your hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes; I had one camera around my neck and the camera I had
just emptied, it was in my lap. I had thrown my film out to this reporter over
the side of the car as we rounded the corner and I still had the camera lying in
my lap, and the other one was around my neck.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this the position you were in at the time you heard
the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. After the third shot and as the car hesitated, did you
see any law enforcement officials move in any concentrated or concerted direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. I saw at least one, there may have been more, run up the School
Depository steps, toward the door. That is one of the things I saw in this
confusion.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was separate from the policeman on the motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Yes, sir. Yes. I should have said that a while ago. There was
a policeman who moved toward the door of the Depository. But to my best
knowledge there was no concentrated movement toward any one spot. It looked
like general confusion to me, and of course, I stayed in the car. As we did
turn the corner our driver speeded up and we went by the scene pretty fast
and I do recall this Negro family covering up their child on the grass, and I,
as we passed them, they were just getting up and he had the child in his arms
and the child looked limp and I didn't know whether the child was shot or
not. But then we were moving fast and went on under the underpass.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Wright, do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. No, Mr. Chief Justice, I passed a question on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I have just one additional question, and that is whether Mr.
Jackson had any occasion to see anybody leave the scene of the Texas School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is all, Your Honor.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Jackson, thank you very much for coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We appreciate it.</p>

<p>Who is next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Rowland.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony given before this Commission will be
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Specter will conduct the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please, but before
you do, Mr. Chief Justice, is it your practice to read that statement to the
witness?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. I will read a short statement to you for the purpose
of the hearing.</p>

<p>The purpose of today's hearing is to hear the testimony of Arnold Louis Rowland,
Amos Lee Euins, James Richard Worrell, and Robert H. Jackson, who
were in the vicinity of the assassination scene on November 22, 1963. The
Commission proposes to ask these witnesses for facts concerning their knowledge
of the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>A copy of that statement was furnished to you, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

morning, in a general way, up until approximately noon time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I went to my classes. My wife got out of school early. We
went to town. I had to go to work at 4, so we were going downtown to do
some shopping. We went early so we could see the President's motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive in town?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The same: Adamson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did her classes end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. She got out at 11 also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do from the time you arrived in town at
approximately a quarter of 12 for the next 15 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Trying to find a good vantage point. We walked about five
or six blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From where did you walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We got off at the junction, at the intersection of Main and
Houston, walked up toward Ervay, about four blocks, I would say up to Akard.
We walked from Houston to Akard on Main, and then we walked back down
Commerce and then over to the sheriffs or the county courthouse, there was
a lesser crowd there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the reason you selected the spot you ultimately picked
to watch the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, there was no one in front of us, no one around that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am going to show you a photograph, Mr. Rowland, which
has already been identified as Commission Exhibit No. 347 and first ask you if
you can identify what scene this represents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What scene is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This is the triple underpass, this is the scene where the President
was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is this plaza called in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't know exactly. It is just known as the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it known as Dealey Plaza to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I have never heard it called that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you point with your finger for me at the spot where you
were standing as best you can recollect it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We were about in this area on this sidewalk of this building.
I say approximately two-thirds of the distance between here and here in this
direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I have a substitute photograph for you to mark. I am now showing you
an identical scene on a photograph which has been heretofore marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 354. Will you mark with an arrow as closely as possible
to the point where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There is an elevator shaft below this second window on that
building that comes through a sidewalk. I was about 5 feet to the left of it,
about the third window or right here in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark that a little more heavily, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time were you so positioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We got there about 5 after 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did your position move at any time during the course of the
next half hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. We did move to this corner, there were too many people
on this corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are indicating back to the corner of Houston and Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. Houston and Main there were too many crowds so we
came back to this street here, Commerce is that right; no, Elm and Main. We
came back to Elm and Main and figured it wouldn't be a very good vantage
point because of the crowd there so we went back to where we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you standing at the time the President's motorcade
passed by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At that position.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The position you have marked with a "V," inverted "V."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Will you mark with the letter "A" the point to which you had moved when
you described it as being at Commerce which you corrected to Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was this corner.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately what time did you move to the position you have
marked "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 10 after 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay at position "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Momentarily, just long enough to look, maybe a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To look at what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. To look at the position itself. There was too much of a crowd
in that area. When the President would come by they would be pushing or
rushing in that area and it would be too crowded for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At that point you did what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Then we went back to where we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To position "V"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, and we stayed there for a minute or so, walked to the
corner of Main and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mark Main and Houston with the letter "B," if you would,
where you moved next.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Stayed there momentarily, less than a minute. There was
quite a crowd there and we went back to where we were, our original position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To position "V"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time would you say you got back to your position "V"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We got back there 14 after, I noticed the time on my watch,
and the Hertz time clock I noticed was about a minute later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was the Hertz time clock located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That was on top of the school depository building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was your watch synchronized with the Hertz up on top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I always set it by the same clock whenever I pass it.
I pass it coming into town and I set my watch at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you observe at any time the building which is depicted
in Commission Exhibit No. 348?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. We were looking around it, my wife and I, amongst the
crowd, the different areas, making note of the policemen on top of the underpass
itself, in that area, and the security precautions that were being taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like to show the witness the same photograph,
but a different picture on an exhibit marked Commission Exhibit No.
356.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowland, I show you a picture marked Commission Exhibit No. 356
and ask you if you can identify what that represents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That is Houston, Elm running in front of this building. This
is the school book depository building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you familiar with that building prior to November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I have been in there on occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have been in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, to purchase books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When were you in the building most recently prior to November
22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Within the first week of November. This was to buy a physics
notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What part of the building were you in at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Just inside the door of the main lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you ever had occasion at any time to be on any floor
other than the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While you were standing on Houston Street in the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
positions which you have described, did you have occasion at any time to observe
the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. When we returned to position "V" we stayed there, we
began looking around. My wife and I were discussing the security precautions
that were taken in view of the event when Mr. Stevenson was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before you go on, let me ask you at which time was this on
your return to position "V"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was 12:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right; proceed to tell us what you saw and heard at about
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We were discussing, as I stated, the different security precautions,
I mean it was a very important person who was coming and we were
aware of the policemen around everywhere, and especially in positions where
they would be able to watch crowds. We talked momentarily of the incidents
with Mr. Stevenson, and the one before that with Mr. Johnson, and this being
in mind we were more or less security conscious. We looked and at that time
I noticed on the sixth floor of the building that there was a man back from
the window, not hanging out the window.</p>

<p>He was standing and holding a rifle. This appeared to me to be a fairly
high-powered rifle because of the scope and the relative proportion of the scope
to the rifle, you can tell about what type of rifle it is. You can tell it isn't
a .22, you know, and we thought momentarily that maybe we should tell someone
but then the thought came to us that it is a security agent.</p>

<p>We had seen in the movies before where they have security men up in windows
and places like that with rifles to watch the crowds, and we brushed it aside
as that, at that time, and thought nothing else about it until after the event
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, by referring to the photograph on this Commission Exhibit
No. 356, will you point to the window where you observed this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was very odd. There were&mdash;this picture was not taken
immediately after that, I don't think, because there were several windows, there
are pairs of windows, and there were several pairs where both windows were
open fully and in each pair there was one or more persons hanging out the
window.</p>

<p>Yet this was on the west corner of the building, the sixth floor, the first floor&mdash;second
floor down from the top, the first was the arched, the larger windows,
not the arch, but the larger windows, and this was the only pair of windows
where both windows were completely open and no one was hanging out the
windows, or next to the window.</p>

<p>It was this pair of windows here at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Will you mark that pair of windows with a circle?</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best recollection as to how far each of those
windows were open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. To the fullest extent that they could be opened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What extent would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Being as I looked half frame windows, that would be halfway
of the entire length of the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the approximate status of those windows depicted here
in Exhibit 356?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In which of those double windows did you see the man and rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was through the window to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Draw an arrow right into that window with the same black
pencil please.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much, if any, or all of that rifle could you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. All of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You could see from the base of the stock down to the tip of the
end of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The barrel of the rifle?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford, will you excuse me for just a few minutes
to run across the street to my office. You conduct during my absence.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Will you proceed, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the distance between where you
were standing and the man holding the rifle whom you have just described?</p>

<p>(The Chief Justice left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. 150 feet approximately, very possibly more. I don't know
for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you very good at judging distances of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Fairly good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had any experience or practice at judging such distances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. Even in using the method in physics or, you know, elementary
physics of looking at a position in two different views, you can tell
its distance. I did that quite frequently. And the best I can recollect it was
within 150 to 175 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe the rifle with any more particularity than you
already have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No. In proportion to the scope it appeared to me to be a .30-odd
size 6, a deer rifle with a fairly large or powerful scope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say, .30-odd-6, exactly what did you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That is a rifle that is used quite frequently for deer hunting.
It is an import.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you own any rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; my stepfather does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever gone hunting deer with such a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that a .30-odd-6 rifle that you have hunted deer with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that a popular size of rifle in the Dallas, Tex., area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't know about Dallas. I do know in Oregon it is one of the
most popular for deer hunting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the rifle which you observed similar to, or perhaps identical
with, .30-odd rifles which you have seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The best I could tell it was of that size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you seen such .30-odd rifles before at close range which
had telescopic sights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; one my stepfather has has a very powerful scope on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did this rifle appear similar to the one your stepfather
owned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. From my distance, I would say very similar or of similar
manufacture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what manner was the rifle being held by the man whom you
observed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The way he was standing it would have been in a position
such as port arms in military terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say port arms you have positioned your left hand
with the left elbow of your hand being about level with your shoulder and
your right <span class="locked">hand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not quite level with my shoulder, and the right hand being
lower on the trigger of the stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So the waist of the imaginary rifle you would be holding would
cross your body at about a 45-degree angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long was the rifle held in that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. During the entire time that I saw him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him hold it in any other position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For example, was he standing at any time in a parade-rest
position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe, as best you can, the appearance of the individual
whom you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He was rather slender in proportion to his size. I couldn't
tell for sure whether he was tall and maybe, you know heavy, say 200 pounds,
but tall whether he would be and slender or whether he was medium and
slender, but in proportion to his size his build was slender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you give us an estimate on his height?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I couldn't. That is why I said I can't state what height
he would be. He was just slender in build in proportion with his width. This
is something I find myself doing all the time, comparing things in perspective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he a white man or a Negro or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Seemed, well, I can't state definitely from my position because
it was more or less not fully light or bright in the room. He appeared
to be fair complexioned, not fair, but light complexioned, but dark hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What race was he then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I would say either a light Latin or a Caucasian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you able to observe any characteristics of his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; except that it was dark, probably black.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to observe whether he had a full head of hair or
any characteristic as to quantity of hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It didn't appear as if he had a receding hairline but I know
he didn't have it hanging on his shoulders. Probably a close cut from&mdash;you
know it appeared to me it was either well-combed or close cut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you observe as to the clothes he was
wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He had on a light shirt, a very light-colored shirt, white or a
light blue or a color such as that. This was open at the collar. I think it was
unbuttoned about halfway, and then he had a regular T-shirt, a polo shirt under
this, at least this is what it appeared to be. He had on dark slacks or blue
jeans, I couldn't tell from that. I didn't see but a small portion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say you only saw a small portion of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Of his pants from his waist down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which half of the window was open, the bottom half or the
top half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was the bottom half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how much, if any, of his body was obscured by the window
frame from that point down to the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. From where I was standing I could see from his head to about
6 inches below his waist, below his belt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you see as far as his knees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your best recollection as to how close to the window
he was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He wasn't next to the window, but he wasn't very far back.
I would say 3 to 5 feet back from the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much of the rifle was separated from your line of vision
by the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The entire rifle was in my view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the open part of the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how much of his body, if any, was in the open view
where there was no window between your eyes and the object of his body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Approximately two-thirds of his body just below his waist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Up to what point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Mid point between the waist and the knees, this is again in
my proportion to his height that I make that judgment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So from the waist, some point between his knees and his waist,
you started to see him clear in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And from that point how far up his body were you able to see
without any obstruction of a window between you and him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. To the top of his head. There was some space on top of
that where I could see the wall behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the space between the top of his
head and the open window at the perspective you were observing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Two and a half, three feet, something on that&mdash;that is something
very hard to ascertain. That would just be an estimation on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there anything else you observed about his appearance or his
clothing or the rifle which you haven't already told us about?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was he facing toward you directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, did you get a full view of his face and
his chest and the front of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He appeared to me as though he were looking out the window
and watching the crowd in particular.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Excuse me, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was he looking toward the corner of Houston and Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I would say he was looking in the area or the general
vicinity of where I was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you were on the sidewalk on Houston in front of
the building that you have indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. Now, I can't&mdash;here again I wasn't close enough to see
his eyes but from the position of his head he was looking in that general area.
It could have been that maybe he was&mdash;his eyes were a little bit off perspective
and he was watching that corner, I don't know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In what position did you say his hands were on the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. One hand was at what is called the gun stock of the rifle,
just above the trigger, it was around the rifle. The other was at the other end
of the rifle about 4 inches below the end of the stock.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was the rifle held above his waist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The majority of it was, just a small portion of butt below
his waist.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The butt or the end of the rifle, the barrel end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The butt, the stock end, was below his waist. The barrel
being pointed in the air toward the ceiling or the wall next to him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I see. The stock was down and the barrel was up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to form any opinion as to the age of that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This is again just my estimation. He was&mdash;I think I remember
telling my wife that he appeared in his early thirties. This could be obscured
because of the distance, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to form any opinion as to the weight of the man
in addition to the line of proportion which you have already described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I would say about 140 to 150 pounds.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you tell your wife you thought he was in
his thirties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Right after I noticed the man, I brought him to my wife's
attention, and she was looking at something else at that time, we looked at
that, and when we both looked back she wanted to see also, and he was gone
from our vision.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So she never saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. My wife never saw him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you say at that time how old he was or how old
you thought he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think I remarked to my wife that he appeared in his thirties,
early thirties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, after you first observed him did you have a conversation
about him with your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Right afterwards. There was&mdash;just before I observed him
there was a police motorcycle parked just on the street, not in front of us, just
a little past us, and the radio was on it giving the details of the motorcade,
where it was positioned, and right after the time I noticed him and when my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
wife was pointing this other thing to me, I don't remember what that was, the
dispatcher came on and gave the position of the motorcade as being on Cedar
Springs. This would be in the area of Turtle Creek, down in that area.</p>

<p>I can't remember the street's name but I know where it is at. And this was
the position of the motorcade and it was about 15 or 16 after 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, did you tell your wife about the presence of this man
immediately after you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the quality or condition of her eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. She has nearsightedness and has to wear glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was she wearing glasses at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, she wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on your knowledge of her eyesight, would it have been
possible for her to have seen him considering your relative positions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Had he still been there she would have been able to acknowledge
the figure with no description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you see him there in total point of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was all relatively brief, short time, 15 seconds, maybe 20.
I was looking at the building, looking at the people hanging out of the building,
I noticed him, my eye contact was at that position for 15 to 20 seconds. This
is all relatively very short length of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. But a lot can happen in that much time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you saw him, you told her about him, and then did she
look in the direction of the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. After she pointed something else out to me she looked in that
direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you then look back toward the direction of, to the window
where you had seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I even pointed to it with my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you look back at the same time she looked back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you looked back what, if anything, did you observe in
the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was nothing there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Following that did you and she have any additional conversation
about this man in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We talked about it momentarily, just for a few seconds that it
was of most likelihood a security man, had a very good vantage point where he
could watch the crowds, talked about the rifle, it looked like a very high-powered
rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you mention that to your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you described as fully as you can everything you discussed
with your wife at that juncture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was there anybody else standing close to you as you had
this conversation with your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was a policeman about as far as me to the flag.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is about how many feet, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Twelve, thirteen feet.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was no one between you and the policeman in that
line of vision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Then there were three or four colored men just behind the elevator, and a
couple on the elevator that had come up through the sidewalk. This was a
distance of&mdash;this was on the opposite side of us about 15 feet, just a little
further than the officer.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was no one closer to you and your wife than 10
to 15 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That is correct. That is one of the main reasons we selected
that spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did it ever enter your mind that you should go and tell
the policeman of this sight or this vision that you had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Really it didn't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It never entered your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I never dreamed of anything such as that. I mean, I must
honestly say my opinion was based on movies I have seen, on the attempted
assassination of Theodore Roosevelt where they had Secret Service men up in
the building such as that with rifles watching the crowds, and another one concerned
with attempted assassination of the other one, Franklin Roosevelt, and
both of these had Secret Service men up in windows or on top of buildings with
rifles, and this is how my opinion was based and why it didn't alarm me.</p>

<p>Perhaps if I had been older and had more experience in life it might have made
a difference. It very well could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Rowland, did the man with the rifle have any distinctive
facial appearance such as a mustache or a prominent scar, anything of that sort
which you could observe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was nothing dark on his face, no mustache. There could
have been a scar if it hadn't been a dark scar. If it was, you know, a blotch or
such as this, there was nothing very dark about the color of his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Rowland, will you recount as precisely and as specifically
as you can, the exact conversation between you and your wife from the time you
first noticed this man until your conversation about the man concluded, indicating
what you said and what she said in language as closely as you can recollect it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That is a whopper.</p>

<p>I am almost sure I told her or asked her, did she want to see a Secret Service
agent. She said, "Where," and I said, "In the building there," and at that
time she told me to look&mdash;I remember what she was looking at. Right directly
across from us in this plaza in front of the pond there was a colored boy that
had an epileptic fit or something of this type right then, and she pointed this out
to me and there were a couple of officers there and a few moments later they
called an ambulance, this is what she told me to look at then, and we looked at
this for a short period of time, and then I told her to look in the building, the
second floor from the top and on that end, the two open windows, is I think what
I said, and I said, "He is not there now."</p>

<p>I think that is what I said. She said, "What did he look like," and I told her
just that&mdash;I gave her more or less a brief description of what he looked like, open
collared shirt, light-colored shirt, and he had a rifle, I described the rifle in as
much detail as I have to you to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You described the rifle to her in as much detail as you have to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>And then she said something about wishing she could have seen him but he
was probably somewhere else in another part of the building watching people
now. Then we were discussing again, just preceding that we were discussing
the event with Mr. Stevenson, this was about 2 weeks beforehand, this was fresh
on our mind, and right after that we started discussing that it was a security
man.</p>

<p>We were looking around, we became very security conscious. We noted that
policemen, I think there were maybe 2, maybe 3 on the viaduct itself; some 20
or 30, I would say 20 to 25 policemen being in that immediate area.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. About what time, as you can best recollect, did this
conversation with your wife take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 5 minutes until about 22 after. I think I again looked
at my watch.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. After you and your wife looked up and saw that there
was no one in the window, did you ever again look at the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I did, constantly.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And as you looked at the window subsequently did you
ever see anything else in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; not in that window, and I looked back every few seconds,
30 seconds, maybe twice a minute, occasionally trying to find him so I could point
him out to my wife.</p>

<p>Something I would like to note is that the window that I have been told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
shots were actually fired from, I did not see that, there was someone hanging
out that window at that time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At the time I saw the man in the other window, I saw this
man hanging out the window first. It was a colored man, I think.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is this the same window where you saw the man standing
with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; this was the one on the east end of the building, the one that
they said the shots were fired from.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I am not clear on this now. The window that you
saw the man that you describe was on what end of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The west, southwest corner.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And the man you saw hanging out from the window
was at what corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The east, southeast corner.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Southeast corner. On the same floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. On the same floor.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you notice him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was before I noticed the other man with the rifle.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I see. This was before you saw the man in the window
with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. My wife and I were both looking and making remarks
that the people were hanging out the windows. I think the majority of them
were colored people, some of them were hanging out the windows to their waist,
such as this. We made several remarks to this fact, and then she started watching
the colored boy, and I continued to look, and then I saw the man with the
rifle.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. After 12:22 or thereabouts you indicated you periodically
looked back at the window in the southwest corner where you had seen the man
with the rifle. What happened as the motorcade came along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. As the motorcade came along, there was quite a bit of excitement.
I didn't look back from then. I was very interested in trying to see the
President myself. I had seen him twice before but I was interested in seeing
him again.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you notice a sedan come by with any officials in it
at the outset of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The first car in the motorcade was, I think it was, a white or
cream-colored Ford. This appeared to be full of detectives or such as this;
rather husky men, large men.</p>

<p>I think there were four in this car.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this an open or a closed car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was a sedan, the doors were closed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What was the next car you noticed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The next car was the President's car.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you notice again or did you look again during this
period of time at the School Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No. From where we were standing the motorcade came down
Main, and when it turned on Houston we watched the motorcade, my wife
remarked at Jackie's clothing, Mrs. Kennedy, and we made a few remarks
of her clothing and how she looked, her appearance in general, and we also
discussed&mdash;we didn't immediately recognize Governor Connally and his wife
being in the car, we were trying to figure out who that was.</p>

<p>Then the motorcade turned on Elm and was obscured from our vision by a
crowd, and we were discussing the clothing of Mrs. Kennedy at that time. My
wife likes clothes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You never again, after the motorcade once came into your
view, looked back at the School Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I did after the shots were fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you finished telling us all about the conversation between
you and your wife concerning this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. To the best of my recollection, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
You have described seeing someone in another window hanging out. Would
you draw a circle and put an "A" beside the window where you say you saw
someone hanging out. That is on Exhibit No. 356.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time was it that you observed someone hanging
out of the window that you have marked as window "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Again about 12:15 just before I noticed the other man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have marked the double window there. Would you draw
the arrow in the red pencil indicating specifically which window it was.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe with as much particularity as you can what
that man looked like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It seemed to me an elderly Negro, that is about all. I didn't
pay very much attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At or about that time did you observe anyone else hanging
out any window or observe any one through any window on the same floor
where you have drawn the two circles on Exhibit 356?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; no one else on that floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You testified before that there were other windows where you
had seen people hanging out, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you tell us and indicate on the picture, Exhibit 356, to
the best of your ability to recollect just which those windows were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was either two or three people in this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mark that with a "B" if you would, please.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Those pair of windows. I think this was all on that floor.</p>

<p>Here on this floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the second floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Circle the windows and mark it with a "C" if you will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think it was this pair immediately over the door, and this
pair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mark one "C" and one "D," if you will.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Here I know there were two Negro women, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating window "C." You say two Negro women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were those women each in one window, both in one window
or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They were one in each window. Then at the window "D" there
was one, one window open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which was that, indicate that by an arrow, if you please.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The one on the west side, and this appeared to have two heads
just inside the window, no one hanging out the window as with the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe anyone else hanging out the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was someone on the third floor. I think it was&mdash;wait a
minute&mdash;yes, the third floor had three adjoining sets of windows that were
open. They were all open to the fullest extent they would open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you mark those "E," "F" and "G," please.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any people in those windows marked "E," "F,"
and "G"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, and this pair, "E," both windows were open, and there
appeared to be one man in the eastern window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which you have now marked with an arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about as to window marked "F"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Both windows were completely up, and there appeared to be
several people in that window, four or five, a number that I don't remember,
you know I couldn't see all of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about window "G"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This again, both windows were open all of the way and I
think there was one person in each window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any other people either through any other
window or hanging out of any other window in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was no one in the fourth floor to my knowledge, to my
recollection.</p>

<p>There were what appeared to be secretaries, several young white girls or
ladies, standing on the steps of the building in this general area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the door of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. And there was no one else in there, except I think there was
a policeman in front of the door on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you described everybody you have observed, with respect
to everybody hanging out the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. To the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or anybody you could see through the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to the window which you have marked "A", that double pair
of windows, which, if either or both, was open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The one on the eastern side was open and not all of the way
it would open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the one you have marked with an arrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much of that window was open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was open about that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating 2½ feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Two feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Two feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Indicating 2 feet. It looked like the windows might open 3&mdash;two-thirds
or three-fourths of the distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the other of the windows in the double-set marked
"A," was that completely closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the windows in the group marked "B," was either
of those windows open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They were both completely open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe with any more particularity the people you
saw in the window which you have marked "B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was a white man hanging out either "G" or "B," I do
not remember which. He was the only white man, besides the man in these
windows that I <span class="locked">saw&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you said "these windows" you mean the first window you
marked with a black circle and a black arrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there anything else you can tell us about the people you saw
in window "B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think to the best of my recollection there was either two or
three people in window "B," and as I stated before, either "B" or "G" had a
white man in the window. I do not remember which. I do remember it was
one of the windows on the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect if the other people in window "B" were white
or Negro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They were Negro.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you have any occasion to look back at window "A"
from the time you saw the man whom you described as a Negro gentleman in
that window until the President's procession passed by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, up until the time the procession <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I suggest, Mr. Specter, we resume the hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you read the last question, Mr. Reporter, please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
(Question read.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you like to start the question again or would you like
the question repeated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I understand the question.</p>

<p>Let me see, the exact time I do not remember, but the man, the colored man,
was in that window until the procession reached Commerce&mdash;I mean Main, and
Ervay. I was looking back quite often, as I stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How do you fix the time that he was there until the procession
reached the intersection of Commerce and Ervay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The police motorcycle was almost in front of me with the
speaker on very loud, giving the relative position about every 15 or 20 seconds of
the motorcade, and this is how I was able to note that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you observing the window which you marked "A" at the
time he departed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, I didn't. I just know, I was looking at the crowd around,
and then I glanced back up again, and neither did I see the man with the rifle
nor did I see him. The colored man went away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long was that after you first noticed the colored man in
the window "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you looked back at window "A" at any time during that
15 minute interval?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you seen anybody in window "A" during that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The colored man was <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So how many times did you notice him altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Several. I think I looked back about two, maybe three times
a minute, an average. I was, you know, trying to find the man with the rifle
to point him out to my wife. I noticed the colored man in that window. I
looked at practically every window in the building but I didn't look at anything
with the detail to see what I was looking for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Over how long a time span did you observe the Negro man to be
in the window marked "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He was there before I noticed the man with the rifle and approximately
12:30 or when the motorcade was at Main and Ervay he was gone
when I looked back and I had looked up there about 30 seconds before or a
minute before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long after you heard the motorcade was at Main and
Ervay did the motorcade pass by where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Another 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that you observed this colored man on the window you have
marked "A" within 5 minutes prior to the time the motorcade passed in
front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Approximately 5 minutes prior to the time the motorcade came,
he wasn't there. About 30 seconds or a minute prior to that time he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A few moments ago in your testimony you stated that in observing
policemen in the area you had observed some officers on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how far were you from the overpass at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. 125 yards approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to observe with clarity the individuals who were
standing on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not with detailed distinction. I do remember there were
three women there, two or three men, a couple of boys, and two officers on the
overpass itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you identify the officers as being policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They were uniformed officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What kind of uniforms were they wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Blue; I think trimmed in gold, uniforms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are those the regular uniforms worn by the Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you standing at the time you observed the people
on the overpass whom you have just described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Position "B."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time was it when you observed those individuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was between the time between 12:15 and 12:30. I think
I looked more than once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times did you look?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't know really. I was more or less scanning the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the individuals present on the triple overpass change at the
various times when you looked in that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't think so. I don't think anyone went off who was up
there or anyone else went on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you now relate what occurred as the Presidential motorcade
passed by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, the car turned the corner at Houston and Main. Everyone
was rushing, pressing the cars, trying to get closer. There were quite a
few people, you know, trying to run alongside of the car such as this; officers
were trying to prevent this. The car turned&mdash;we had more or less a long period
of time that they were within our sight considering some of the other people.</p>

<p>The car went down Houston, again turned on Elm, and it was proceeding
down Elm when we heard the first of the reports. This I passed off as a backfire,
so did practically everyone in the area because gobs of people, when I say
gobs, I mean almost everyone in the vicinity, started laughing that couldn't
see the motorcade. The motorcade was obscured from our vision by the
crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would the occasion be for laughter on the sound of a
backfire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't know. A lot of people laughed. I don't know. But
a lot of people laughed, chuckled, such as this. Then approximately 5 seconds,
5 or 6 seconds, the second report was heard, 2 seconds the third report. After
the second report, I knew what it was, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I knew that it was a gun firing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I have been around guns quite a bit in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the sound of the fire different from the first and second
sounds you described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, that is just it. It did not sound as though there was any
return fire in that sense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by return fire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That anyone fired back. You know, anyone in the procession
such as our detectives or Secret Service men fired back at anything else. It gave
the report of a rifle which most of the Secret Service men don't carry in a
holster although I am sure they had some in the cars but the following two
shots were the same report being of the same intensity. I state, because from a
different position I know that the same rifle is not going to make the same
sound in two different positions especially in a position such as it was, because
of the ricocheting of sound and echo effects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your basis for saying that, Mr. Rowland, that the rifle
would not make the same sound in two different positions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This is due to a long study of sound and study of echo effects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When had you conducted that study?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. In physics in the past 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you read any special books on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Quite a few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect any of the titles and authors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you take any special courses which would give you insight
into that subject matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was more or less on my own initiative. The instructor
gave me help and aided me when I requested this during my off periods of
class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What instructor was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. His name was Foster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what school does he teach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He teaches at Crozier Tech, Downtown Technical High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is he still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. To my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How recently did you have a course with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Last year, last school year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe the second sound by comparison with the first
sound which you have described as being similar to a backfire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The second to my recollection was identical or as closely as
could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Sounded the same to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any impression or reaction as to the point of
origin when you heard the first noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, I began looking, I didn't look at the building mainly, and
as practically any of the police officers that were there then will tell you, the
echo effect was such that it sounded like it came from the railroad yards. That
is where I looked, that is where all the policemen, everyone, converged on the
railroads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say railroad yards, what area are you referring to?
Identify it on Commission Exhibit No. 354, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. In this area in here.</p>

<p>Now most of the officers converged on this <span class="locked">area&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "in here," I will get a black pencil here and
see if we can draw a circle around the area where you have described the echo
effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The echo effect felt as though it came from this general
vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mark that with the letter "C" in the center of your circle.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as to the second shot, did you have any impression as to
the point of origin or source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The same point or very close to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Very close to the same position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you look, if you recall, after you heard the first shot,
in what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We were standing here at position "B." At the sound of the
second report, I proceeded across the street. My wife was very anxious to find
out what was going on. I proceeded to cross the street like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating you were&mdash;she was pulling you ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. She was very anxious to find out what was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That was at the sound of the second report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you mark with this black pencil, with the letter "D,"
where you went to, as she pulled you across the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We crossed the street in this area, proceeded down the sidewalk,
around here, there was quite a bit of crowd, people were running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you at the time that you heard the second report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At the second report we were approximately at the curb, out
from the curb, we were off the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At point "V"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the third shot, where were you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At the third shot I was in this vicinity halfway to where we
crossed the street to the end of the block.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you indicate with the letter "D" where you were at the
time of the third shot?</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you look when you heard the third report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, we were trying to actually see the President's car, that
is what my wife was trying to do, and then I decided I might as well give in to
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After the shots occurred, did you ever look back at the Texas
School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I did not. In fact, I went over toward the scene of the
railroad yards myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you not look back at the Texas School Book Depository
Building in view of the fact that you had seen a man with a rifle up there earlier
in the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember. It was mostly due to the confusion, and then
the fact that it sounded like it came from this area "C," and that all the officers,
enforcement officers, were converging on that area, and I just didn't pay any
attention to it at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many officers were converging on that area, to the best
of your ability to recollect and estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think it would be a very good estimation of 50, maybe more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how fast the President's automobile was driving
as it proceeded in front of you when you were standing at position "B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Very slow pace, 5, 10 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, if at all, did you first report what you had observed
in the Texas School Book Depository Building about the man with the rifle
to anyone in an official position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That was approximately 15 minutes after the third report
that I went to an officer, he was a plainclothesman who was there combing
the area, close to position "C," looking for footprints and such as this, some
lady said someone jumped off one of the colonnades and started running, there
was an officer looking in this area for footprints and such as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that lady ever identified to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I do not remember his name. He introduced himself and
showed me his ID.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I mean the lady you talked about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now as to the officer to whom you made a report, was he a
State, City or Federal official, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was a Dallas detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you give him a statement or what procedure did he
follow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It happened such as this: He was looking in this area for
footprints or any visible marks. I started looking around also. I found a
fountain pen that someone had probably dropped during the confusion or fell
out of their pocket when they fell on the ground or such. I picked it up and
handed it to him. I had on gloves, I wasn't to mess up the fingerprints because
it very possibly could have fallen out of the pocket of the man who supposedly
had jumped down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were wearing gloves on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it a chilly day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The sun was shining, it was a fair day but the wind was
blowing and it was breezy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it cold enough to have gloves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I had on my overcoat and my wife had a fairly heavy coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Proceed, and tell us what you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I handed this pen to the officer and I started thinking and I
went to him and told him again just before the motorcade came I saw a man
in the building with a rifle, and he immediately took me to Sheriff Decker
which, in turn, asked two other deputies to take me to his office. We went
there to his office. There was quite a few reporters around, such as this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
They took my wife and I to a back room and shut us off completely from the
reporters and everyone. There was no one in that room for 4 hours but this
sheriff and a FBI agent, Agent Sorrels, and a stenographer, and I think
another lady and a man that had seen another man carrying a rifle in a case
on the other end of town earlier prior to this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you sure there was a court reporter present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was one of the secretaries from the office of the sheriff,
stenographer who was taking, using an electric typewriter every time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was she taking down in <span class="locked">shorthand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you could <span class="locked">observe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Each word that you were saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did she have any sort of a machine, such as a stenograph, as
the gentleman who is serving as court reporter has?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; she took it down in shorthand and retyped it on an electric
typewriter that she brought into the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did she type up what you had said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; typed up three or four copies and then I signed it at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now show you a photostatic copy of what purports to be an
affidavit which you gave to the Sheriff's Department of the County of Dallas,
Tex., on November 22, 1963, and has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 357.
Would you take a look at that, take your time, of course, and tell us whether
or not that is the affidavit which you took on the occasion which you have just
related?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. In fact, at this time I also noted that my wife dragged
me across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Just one detail on that statement: There is a reference here to
the man holding the rifle being in a position which you describe as "a parade-rest
sort of position." That <span class="locked">appears&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It does appear in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Eighteen lines down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I see it. It wasn't a parade-rest position. It was a
port-arms position. I never noticed that in there before. There were&mdash;actually,
I will say this, I said what I had to say. The FBI agent reworded it, and
she took it down.</p>

<p>Now this happened; it wasn't my words verbatim, it was reworded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever use the words "parade-rest" position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So it is just an error in transcription which you did not notice
when you signed it.</p>

<p>(At this point, Chief Justice Warren entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Is there any other aspect of the affidavit which you gave, which you have
just observed, which is at variance with your current recollection of what you
saw and heard on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Here it states we were at the west entrance of the sheriff's
office, that is just a general approximation, we were 25 feet from there, in
fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other portions of it which vary from your
current recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember saying definitely that he was back about
15 feet. In fact, I think I said, as I said now, 3 to 5 feet, because from
my point of view if he was back 15 feet I couldn't have even seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other parts of the affidavit which vary from your
current recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The actual time between the reports I would say now, after
having had time to consider the 6 seconds between the first and second report
and two between the second and third. It is very fast for a bolt-loading
rifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether or not the statement is accurate in
that you told the police officials at that time that there was a time span of 8
seconds between the first and second shots and a time span of 3 seconds
between the second and third shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think I did tell them that, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And with respect to the facts which appear in the statement
that you said the man was standing about 15 feet back from the windows,
did you actually tell them that when you made the statement, or is that an
error of transcription?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't think I said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now are there any other points where the affidavit is at
variance from your current recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The time that it states here, we arrived in downtown Dallas
at approximately 12:10. Actually we arrived before 12 but we took the
position that we have, approximately 12:10, that position "V" on this other
Exhibit 354.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other variances between your current recollection
and this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I do not think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you tell the police officials at the time you made this
statement that there was a Negro gentleman in the window on the southwest
corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building which you have
marked with a circle "A"&mdash;pardon me, southeast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At that time, no. However, the next day on Saturday there
were a pair of FBI officers, agents out at my home, and they took another
handwritten statement from me which I signed again, and this was basically
the same. At that time I told them I did see the Negro man there and they
told me it didn't have any bearing or such on the case right then. In fact,
they just the same as told me to forget it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Reporter, will you please repeat that last answer for us?</p>

<p>(Answer read.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am now handing you a document which I have marked as
Commission Exhibit No. 358, which purports to be a reproduction of a
statement which was purportedly given by you to the FBI, two agents of that
Bureau.</p>

<p>Will you take a look at that and tell us if that is the statement which
you gave to the FBI to which you just referred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Again, I have a variance of time and a variance of distance
that he was from the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before you direct your attention to those factors, Mr. Rowland,
are you able to tell us whether or not this is the statement which you
gave to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. My wife was with me when I gave the statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And without looking at the statement which, may the record
show, you are not now doing, do you recollect the names of the FBI, don't
look there, just tell me if you can recollect without seeing their names on
the statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; I talked to seven different pairs of FBI agents
and I don't remember their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Seven different pairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir; I had&mdash;this is only one of the statements. They
came to my home or where I worked and took three more besides this one. There
were four handwritten statements that I signed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before getting the details on those, tell me in what respect,
if any, the statement which we have identified as Commission Exhibit No.
358 differs from what you told the FBI agents at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I do not think it differs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then that statement accurately reflects what you said at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I am sure it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, in what respects, if any, does that statement vary from
your current recollection about the facts which are contained therein?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The time factor, the time that we arrived in town. Here
again it states 12:10. Now this is the time that we arrived at the position that
we stayed at, not the time we arrived in town, and the distance the man was
back from the window. Here it states 12 to 15 feet. I do not remember
saying that although I very well could have. Everything was confusing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But what is your current recollection on the distance that the
man was back from the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Three to four, five feet, somewhere in that neighborhood. He
wasn't very far. Far enough for the sunlight to hit him and at the angle
the sun was that wouldn't be very far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now noticing that the date on that statement is November 24,
1963, does that appear to you to be the date when that statement was
taken, or was it taken on the 23d, the day after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was Saturday morning, the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On what day was the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was Thursday, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; the assassination occurred on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I am sorry, that is right. It is so confused in this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, was the statement taken the second day after the assassination
or the morning of the first day after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; it was taken on Saturday morning before I went to
work because on Sunday there was another statement taken from me at my
job where I was working. This occurred right after Oswald was shot
himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, are you able to identify that statement which we have
marked Exhibit 358, as the statement taken on Saturday, the 23d, as distinguished
from the statement taken on Sunday, the 24th of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How can you be certain of that, Mr. Rowland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The one on Sunday, this particular one, I do remember
the agent used a legal pad. He did have three pages of it handwritten. I
made corrections on this in different parts of it. The one on Sunday was
not a legal pad. It was a steno pad and it, in fact, covered a page and a
half, I think, and it was concerned with mainly could I identify the man
that I saw, his description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, at the time you made the Saturday statement, which
you say was transcribed and appears as Exhibit 358, did you at that time
tell the interviewing FBI agents about the colored gentleman who you
testified was in the window which you marked with an "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ask them at that time to include the information
in the statement which they took from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No. I think I told them about it after the statement, as
an afterthought, an afterthought came up, it came into my mind. I also
told the agents that took a statement from me on Sunday. They didn't
seem very interested, so I just forgot about it for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that information included in the written portion of
the statement which was taken from you on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, it wasn't. It shouldn't but the agent deleted it though
himself, I mean I included it in what I gave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say deleted it, did he strike it out after putting it
in, or did he omit it in the transcription?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Omitted it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you said a while ago that when you told the
FBI agents on Saturday that you had seen this Negro man in the window,
that they indicated to you that they weren't interested in it at all. What
did they say which gave you that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember exactly what was said. The context
was again the agents were trying to find out if I could positively identify the
man that I saw. They were concerned mainly with this, and I brought up
to them about the Negro man after I had signed the statement, and at that
time he just told me that they were just trying to find out about or if anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
could identify the man who was up there. They just didn't seem interested
at all. They didn't pursue the point. They didn't take it down in the
notation as such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It was more of the fact that they didn't pursue it, didn't
include it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or that they said something which led you to believe they
were not interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was just the fact they didn't pursue it. I mean, I just
mentioned that I saw him in that window. They didn't ask me, you know, if
was this at the same time or such. They just didn't seem very interested
in that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. By man who was up there you mean man with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They were interested in the man with the rifle, and finding
out if anyone could identify him. The other man was the colored man in
the other window.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A minute ago you indicated that you could see the
man in the window with the rifle because of the light conditions, I think you
referred to the sun shining in that direction toward the building. Was the
sun bright, do you recall that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; the sun was out, somewhat bright. I didn't have any
sunglasses on at that time because I had broken them the week before, and
I hadn't gotten any new ones. The sun was shining in from what I could
tell he was standing where I seen him through the window on my right.
This would be the east window of the pair. It appeared as though the sun
were shining in through either a window on the other side of the building,
on the west side of the building, or possibly the western pair, one of the
pair. This sun was&mdash;that hit him about from the shoulders down as far
as I could see, that is why I was able to tell the rifle was of the type or
such that it was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As you faced the window, as you faced the building,
the sun was shining over which shoulder, to your left or your right shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. As I faced the building the sun was shining&mdash;well, I would
have been facing the building if the building were in this direction more or less
this way and the sun would have been shining from this area.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Over your left shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; forward.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to identify the man whom you saw in the window
with the rifle for the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they have pictures with them at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I have seen three pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald, two of them
in the paper. They had a morning newspaper was all they had. It wasn't a
very good picture, and I couldn't tell. I didn't know, I wasn't going to say
because I didn't, I mean. I just couldn't identify him. I wouldn't be&mdash;I had
already resigned myself not to be given that task, because I couldn't definitely say
any one man was that man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the basis of your concluding, as you put it, that
you resigned yourself to that task?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was because I just didn't have a good enough look at his
face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that your conclusion at this moment that you are unable
to identify, with precision and certainty, the man whom you saw holding the
rifle in the window of the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you believe that you could identify the Negro gentleman in
window "A" whom you testified you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I would have to say perhaps. I can't say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A moment ago you testified that you gave statements to seven
different pairs of FBI agents. Have you already testified about three of those
occasions, or, stated differently, start at the beginning and tell us, as best you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
can recollect, what were those occasions, when they occurred, where you were
when you had those meetings with the seven different pairs of agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The first statement I gave was in the sheriff's office on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there two FBI agents present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you recollect their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was the second occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that statement given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That was in the agent's car in front of my mother-in-law's
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect the identities of those FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is the statement you have identified as being reproduced in
Commission Exhibit 358?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, when was the third statement obtained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was Sunday morning, the following day, November 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that statement obtained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was at my place of employment at the Pizza Inn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, Sunday after the assassination would have been the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; that is right, I am sorry, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you certain of the day of the week, however?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I am certain of that because I went to work at noon on
Sunday and they were there when I got to work, they were waiting on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is the statement which you described as having been taken
on a stenopad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you sign that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I did. This was in the presence of my wife because she
was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect the identity of those FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I do not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was the fourth statement taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The fourth was Tuesday night of that week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of the following week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that statement taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was at my mother-in-law's house, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that reduced to writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That was merely one paragraph. They were concerned with
identification of the man that I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you tell them essentially at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The description and that I could not positively identify him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you sign a statement for them at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the identity of those FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Up to this point were any of the FBI agents the same who had
interviewed you and taken statements from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did the fifth occasion take place when you were interviewed
by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was again where I worked. This was, it was not a
formal written statement. They just took notes on what I said, had me recount
that entire thing to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did this occur, the fifth one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was on the following Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time of the day or night was it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 8:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the Pizza Inn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; Dallas time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you recall the identities of those FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were they the same as any who had ever interviewed you
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; none of them are the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was the sixth occasion when you were interviewed by
the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was again on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This would have been November&mdash;it would have been December
1st?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember that date but it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The second Sunday after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was the sixth interview conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This was at the Pizza Inn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time of the day or night was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 1 o'clock. This was again right after I came to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the statement taken from you at that time reduced to
writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was again informal, just taking notes on my statement,
had me recount what I had told the other agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were they interested in specifically at that time if you
recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They just wanted me to recount everything that I could recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the identity of those agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were they again different agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From all those you had seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When had you given the seventh statement to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The last statement I gave I think it was to one FBI agent
and a Secret Service Agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did that occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That was either Tuesday or Wednesday of the week. I do
not remember which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the week following the Sunday when you gave the sixth
statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall the identities of those men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you ever seen either before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; I hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they reduce your statement to writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; they just had me recount everything again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In addition to the times you have already stated, have you ever
been interviewed by the FBI on any other occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever been interviewed by the Secret Service on any
other occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The afternoon of the 22d and the seventh time was the only
two times of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. There was a Secret Service agent present in the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; he was Agent Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you gave the affidavit which we have identified as Commission
Exhibit 357?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In addition to the times you have mentioned, have you ever
been interviewed by any agent or representative of the Federal Government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been interviewed by any other agent or representative
of the State Government of Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, on any of the other occasions, other than those you
testified about, did you mention seeing the Negro gentleman in the window which
we have circled with the "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Rowland, what was the quality of your grades in high
school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, up until my senior year they were 4.0 straight A's, in
my senior year I got a couple of B's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what your IQ or intelligence quotient is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. 147.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know when you were tested for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. In 1963; in May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Rowland, a couple of other questions.</p>

<p>Are you able to give us any other type of a description of the Negro gentleman
whom you observed in the window we marked "A" with respect to height,
weight, age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He was very thin, an elderly gentleman, bald or practically
bald, very thin hair if he wasn't bald. Had on a plaid shirt. I think it was
red and green, very bright color, that is why I remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give us an estimate as to age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Fifty; possibly 55 or 60.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give us an estimate as to height?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. 5'8", 5'10", in that neighborhood. He was very slender, very
thin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give us a more definite description as to complexion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Very dark or fairly dark, not real dark compared to some
Negroes, but fairly dark. Seemed like his face was either&mdash;I can't recall detail
but it was either very wrinkled or marked in some way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Shortly after the assassination and before these interviews
that you described were completed, Mr. Rowland, had you learned or heard
that the shots were supposed to have come out of the window which we have
marked with the "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir. I did not know that, in fact until Saturday when
I read the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which Saturday is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The following Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that be the second day, the day after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, knowing that, at that time, did you attach any particular
significance to the presence of the Negro gentleman, whom you have described,
that you saw in window "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; that is why I brought it to the attention of the FBI agents
who interviewed me that day. This was as an afterthought because I did not
think of it firsthand. But I did bring it to their attention before they left,
and <span class="locked">they&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That was at the interview on the Saturday morning November
23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you think it of sufficient significance to bring it to the
attention of any of the other interviewing FBI agents on the balance of the
interviews you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I did on the following Sunday to the agents who interviewed
me where I worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the following Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, at this time I move for the admission into
evidence of the three exhibits which we have shown this witness.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Exhibits Nos. 356, 357, and 358. That completes our questioning,
Your Honor.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission's Exhibits Nos. 356,
357, and 358 for identification and admitted into evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator Cooper, have you any questions?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said earlier that you had been much interested in and
pursued studies in sounds, I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I have studied quite a bit of electronics, sound. Math and
science is what I like.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said you had read books on this subject. Did you ever
conduct any experiments yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; in the form of&mdash;there is a theory that sound is a basis of
a transmitter and a receiver, that you have to have a receiver to have sound.
There is a theory that if a tree falls down in the middle of a forest and there
is nobody around where they can hear it, there is no sound.</p>

<p>Well, I have conducted experiments on this, and I&mdash;it is very interesting,
very fascinating, but you can't prove it or you can't disprove it because if you
have got a microphone there you have got a receiver.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you ever conduct any experiments with rifles, firing
a rifle in relation to sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; in a firing range.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Beg pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Firing range.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I did conduct a few experiments. One of them was firing
a bullet over water; you know, we were using a set of wood blocks to fire into,
so we had a big vat of water that we were firing over, and we had several
different articles and composition floating on the water, trying to measure the
effect of the sound wave upon that. Such as this we did conduct.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you did say that when you heard the first report that
you considered it to be a rifle shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I did, but almost immediately everyone started laughing
so I did not give it any further consideration until the second shot, second report.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. At the time you saw a man standing near a window in the
Texas School Book Depository with a rifle, can you state whether there were
any, did you know whether or not any police officers were near you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There was an officer about 20 feet to my left.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see any others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. There were officers all over, that was the closest one. There
were four or five on the block across the street from me, two of them being
with the boy who had the epileptic fit.</p>

<p>There was also an officer in front of the doors to that building. There were
several on the corners. I would say there were 20 uniformed officers right there
in that 1½-block area.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Could any of the officers that you saw whose position you
noted, have seen this window from the place where they were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They could have; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You don't remember whether any of them were looking up
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I don't remember whether they were. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did it occur to you that you should speak to the officer about
seeing a man in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It has. Do you ever have reoccurring dreams, sir?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Do you ever have reoccurring dreams?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. This is a reoccurring dream of mine, sir, all the time, what if
I had told someone about it. I knew about it enough in advance and perhaps
it could have been prevented. I mean this is something which shakes me up at
times.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I don't want to disturb you about that but my point was at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
time did you&mdash;I think you said, though, you thought that he was a&mdash;he could have
been a&mdash;Secret Service man, officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Anything further, Congressman Ford?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Rowland, have you ever had occasion to go back to
the scene and reconstruct it? Have you ever gone <span class="locked">back&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Supposing we take a few minutes recess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The answer to that question is yes; I do all the time. I pass that
area very frequently.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Any other questions, gentlemen, Mr. Wright?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. No, Your Honor.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well, Mr. Rowland, I want to thank you for coming here
and cooperating with the Commission. I know that this is a matter that recalls
very sordid thoughts to your mind, and I can see how you would be somewhat
distressed about it but you have been very frank and cooperative with us and I
appreciate it.</p>

<p>We will take a short recess.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Average.</p>

<p>(The Chief Justice entered the hearing room at this point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How were you occupied or employed back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I was in school then. I skipped school to go there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were attending Jefferson High School on that day or were
enrolled at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I was enrolled but I hadn't been going since October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any special reason for your not going since October?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you been employed anywhere from the time you stopped
going to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir. I was employed for El Capitan Oil Drilling out in
Kermit, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What sort of work were you doing for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I was a floor man on a derrick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you say floor man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you working on that day for your
employer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No. I didn't start this oil job until&mdash;it was the last of January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you working for them at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom are you working for now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I am not employed now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then going back to November 22, 1963, you had no job at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you attend school that day at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline for us briefly what your activities were from
the time you awakened until about noon time on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I got up about, well, I got up at my usual time, about 6:30.
I was going to go to school that day but I decided to go see the President and
my mother left about 7:30, and my sister left about a quarter of 8. I left about
8, and hitchhiked down to Love Field and got there. It took me quite a while
to get there, about 9, and just messed around there until the President come in,
whatever time that was. And then I didn't get to see him good at all. So, I
caught a bus and went over, went downtown and I just, I don't know, happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
to pick that place at the Depository, and I stood at the corner of Elm and
Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you leave Love Field before the President did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you happen to leave Love Field before he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, so I could see him better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Couldn't you get a good view of him at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, I just saw him off the plane and I figured that I wasn't going
to see him good so I was going to get a better place to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you travel from Love Field down to Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Bus. No, no; I just traveled so far on the bus. I went down
to Elm, and took a bus from there. I went down as far as, I don't know where
that bus stops, anyway I got close to there and I walked the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time, to the best of your recollection, did you arrive at
the intersection of Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, about 10, 10:30, 10:45, something around there. There
weren't many people standing around there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, about how long before the Presidential motorcade came
to Elm and Houston did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. An hour; an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you sure you were at Love Field when the President arrived
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now I am going to show you a photograph which I
have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 359. Take a look at that, if you would,
please, and tell us whether or not you can identify what scene that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, this is Elm, Pacific, and Commerce. This is the Depository
right here, and this is Stemmons, and this is the way the President come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So is that the assassination scene itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now take a look at that picture and tell us where you were
standing&mdash;and I will give you a pencil so you can mark it on that picture itself&mdash;at
the time the Presidential motorcade came by. Mark it with an "X," if you
would, just exactly where you were standing, as best as you can recollect it, at
this moment, at the time the President went by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Right underneath that window right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, how close were you standing to this building which I will
ask you to identify; first of all, what building is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. That is the Texas Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now how close to that building were you standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I was, I don't know, 4 or 5 feet out from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you standing with your face to the building, with your
back to the building, or how?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. My back was to the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a photograph which has been identified as Commission
Exhibit 360 and I will ask you if you can identify what that building is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. That is the Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now on this picture will you again, with an "X," mark where you were standing
as closely as you can recollect it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. That car is in the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Put the mark then right above where the car is, indicating
where you were standing on the sidewalk near that building.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you observe the President's motorcade come by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe to us what you saw, heard, and observed at that time,
as the motorcade came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I saw him&mdash;I was standing looking&mdash;I don't know my
directions very well; anyway, I was looking down towards Elm Street watching
him come, and they filed by <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On which street were you watching them come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. This way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Look at Exhibit 359 and pick out which street they were on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. They were coming down this way, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, now, were they coming down Elm Street or were they
coming down Main Street with a right-hand turn on to Houston Street with a
curve on Houston down Elm, recollect it if you can?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. That is right. They did turn around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they come <span class="locked">down&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I didn't see him up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was the President's motorcade at the time you first saw
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, about right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Proceeding in this direction, indicating in a generally northerly
direction on Houston Street, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then tell us what the President's motorcade did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. It turned and went down this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Made a left-hand or right-hand turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Left-hand turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did it pass right by in front of where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Within a hundred feet, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to get a pretty good view of the President's
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right; go ahead and tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Didn't get too good a view of the President either, I missed out
on there too. But as they went by, they got, oh at least another 50, 75 feet on
past me, and then I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe anything at about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir, I looked up and saw the rifle, but I would say about
6 inches of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you see the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I am not going&mdash;I am not too sure but I told the FBI it was
either in the fifth or the sixth floor on the far corner, on the east side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now looking at the picture which we have identified as Commission
Exhibit No. 360, which is where you have drawn an "X," can you indicate
the line of vision which you followed to the point where the rifle was to the
best of your ability to recollect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, when I heard the first shot it was too loud to be a firecracker,
I knew that, because there was quite a big boom, and I don't know,
just out of nowhere, I looked up like that, just straight up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating you looked straight back over your head, raising your
head to look over your body at the 90 degree angle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes; and I saw it for the second time and I looked back to
the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I saw about 6 inches of the gun, the rifle. It had&mdash;well it had
a regular long barrel but it had a long stock and you could only see maybe 4
inches of the barrel, and I could <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to observe any of the stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much of the stock were you able to observe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Just very little, just about 2 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many inches of the barrel then could you observe protruding
beyond the stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. About 4 inches, I would say, not very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, at the time of the second shot were you able to observe
anything at that precise instant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. You mean as to firing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to anything at all. What did you see when the second shot
went off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I looked to see where he was aiming and after the second
shot and I have seen the President slumping down in the seat, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see the President slump in his seat after the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Uh, huh. And about <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you look up and see the rifle between the first and the
second shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir. And saw the firing on the second and then before he
could get a shot I was&mdash;I took in everything but especially the car, the President's
car, and saw him slumping, and I looked up again and turned around
and started running and saw it fire a third time, and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you see it fire a third time, when you looked up, the
time you just described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. When I was, I did it all in one motion, I looked up, turned around
and ran, pivoted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you hear, if anything, after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Just a lot of commotion, everybody was screaming and saying
"duck."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After the third shot, did you hear a fourth shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes. Just as I got to the corner of Exhibit 360, I heard
the fourth shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, did these four shots come close together or how would
you describe the timing in general on those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Succession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were they very fast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. They were right in succession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now going back to the position of the rifle which you testified
that you saw, you say it was either on the fifth or sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any way you can tell us which floor it was on, or
would the angle of your observation permit you to be sure it was the fifth or
sixth floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I am not going to say I am positive, but that one there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, would you mark that <span class="locked">one&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Because that right there, I feel, would have obstructed my
vision but I said it was either on the fifth or sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, now, will you mark with a "Y" the window which you
have just pointed to?</p>

<p>(At this point Chief Justice Warren departed the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. A "Y?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A "Y."</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have marked the "Y" over two windows. Was it the
window&mdash;which window was it there as best you can recollect, as between those
two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I didn't mean to bring it down that far but this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you put an arrow then at the window that you have
just indicated, was the one where the rifle was protruding from?</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, the sum of it is you are not sure whether it was the fifth
or the sixth floor, but you believe it was on the floor where you have marked a
"Y" which is the sixth floor and that was the line of vision as you looked
straight up over your head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you run, which is what you have just described that
you did next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, a better view of it is here in 360. I ran down Houston
Street alongside the building and then crossed over the street, I ran alongside
the building and crossed over, and in 359, I was standing over here, and I saw
this man come bustling out of this door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before you get to that, Mr. Worrell, let me show you a diagram
which has been prepared here, which may be of some assistance to you in
telling us your movements in running. I will mark this as Commission Exhibit
361 and ask Mr. David Belin, Staff Counsel, to make a statement as to the
preparation of this exhibit for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The record will show that Exhibit 361 was prepared in the
exhibit section of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by Inspector Leo. J.
Gauthier and Eugene Paul Airy, exhibit specialist, with the assistance of
Charles D. Musser, illustrator, with particular reference to showing the Texas
School Book Depository Building, and the immediate area with relation to the
parking lot that employees used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Worrell, take a good look at this. Study it for just a
moment in order to get your bearings on this particular map. This is the Texas
School Book Depository Building designated as such. This is Houston Street
and this is the direction I am indicating that the motorcade, as you have
described from the other exhibit, came from, a generally northerly direction.
This is generally north, and it made the left-hand turn which you have already
described for the record, onto Elm Street Parkway going down the front there.</p>

<p>Now perhaps the best place to start on this is with this red pencil, to put a
small "X" where you were standing on this map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Where I was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where you were standing.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now will you describe your movement in running as you had
started to a few moments ago, indicating with a line of the red pencil just
exactly where you went and describe it as you go along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, as I said on the third shot I was looking up and pivoting
and turning to run at the same time. When I got here I heard the fourth shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating that you were at that point right at the corner of
the building on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Making a turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Having moved slightly to your left, and beginning to make a
turn to go in a generally northerly direction on Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I thought that was north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No, this is north, there is a symbol showing which is north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Okay. Then I turned the corner, went right down beside the
building on the sidewalk and when I got to the <span class="locked">corner&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Corner of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Of this building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Cut directly across, kind of at an angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Across Houston Street as you have drawn the red line there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, and I rested there, I was out of breath, I smoke too much,
short winded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark that "Y" where you stopped and rested and tell
us how long you stopped there?</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. How long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I was there approximately 3 minutes before I saw this man
come out the back door here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now will you put a "Z" where you first saw the man whom you have just
described or mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. It is here I am pretty sure, I am not positive.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are pretty sure&mdash;but you can't be positive&mdash;but you are
pretty sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Okay. Now, describe as best you can the man whom you have
testified you saw at point "Z."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Describe his appearance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. Start by telling us how tall he was, to the best of your
ability to recollect and estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. To the&mdash;it is going to be within 3 inches, 5-7 to 5-10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to his weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. 155 to 165.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to his height?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. 5-7, 5-10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Pardon me, your best estimate as to his age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, the way he was running, I would say he was in his late
twenties or middle&mdash;I mean early thirties. Because he was fast moving on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of what race was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. White.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe the characteristics of his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Black.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I will say brunette.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he have a full head of hair, a partial head of hair, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, see, I didn't see his face, I just saw the back of his head
and it was full in the back. I don't know what the front looked like. But it
was full in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What clothes did the man have on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Dark, like a jacket like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating a dark gray jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, no. It was a jacket like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A suit jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or was it a sports jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Sports jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did not have on matching coat and trousers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it dark in color or light?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. It was dark in color. I don't know whether it was blue, black,
or brown, but it was dark, and he had light pants. And that is all I can say on
his clothes, except his coat was open and kind of flapping back in the breeze
when he was running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, are there any other distinguishing characteristics that you
can describe about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. He wasn't holding nothing when he was running. He was just
running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe him do, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, when he ran out here, he ran along the side of the Depository
Building and then when he <span class="locked">got&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Make a dotted line as to where he went, or take this black pencil
and make a line as to where he went.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you see him eventually go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, he went on further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the last you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did something come between you and him so that your
vision was obstructed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As of the point you have just dotted out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What obstructed your view of him at that juncture or at that
point?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I can't really be sure, it was a building, but the type of building,
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During the course of your seeing him, did you ever get a view
of his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, no, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. What did you do next, Mr. Worrell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I went on down this way and headed up back to Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating you went on down to Pacific?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And then <span class="locked">proceeded&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, no; that is wrong. I went on Pacific <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Just a minute. You proceeded from point "Y" on in a generally
northerly direction to Pacific and then in what direction did you go on Pacific,
this would be in an easterly direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I went east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You went in an easterly direction how many blocks down
Pacific?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I went down to Market and from Market I went on Ross.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You went left on Market down to Ross, and then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. From Ross I went all the way to Ervay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you heading for at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. For the bus stop near my mother's office. And I rode the bus
from there out to the school and hitchhiked the rest of the way to Farmers
Branch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. When did you first report to any official what you
had seen and heard on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I turned the TV on early next morning to see what had
happened, and Chief Curry was making a <span class="locked">plea&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is that going to become a part of the evidence at this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Chief Curry was making a plea for anyone who had seen the
shooting, would they please come down and make a statement. So I called
the Farmer Branch police, and told them, and they come and picked me up, and
they called the Dallas police, and they come way out there and picked me up
and took me downtown to make a statement and brought me back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Worrell, before we leave this Exhibit 361, are you able to
testify as to the accuracy of the scale drawing here which represents the part
of it that you have testified about, specifically the presence of the Texas School
Book Depository Building on the northwest corner of Elm and Houston. Is
that the accurate location of that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is it an accurate reproduction of the intersection of Elm
and Houston leading into the parkway on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. As far as this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As far as all the parts you have testified about Elm and Houston.
Is it accurate that Pacific is one block in the northerly direction away from
Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And Ross is another block, generally, in a northerly direction
away from Pacific?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, Ross is over here. This is Record Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, first there is Elm, then there is Pacific, and then there
is Ross. Is that much accurate as the map shows it to be, is that the way the
streets are laid out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the general width of Houston Street in relation to
the general width of the Texas School Depository Building, is that about right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I don't know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, that is fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
At the same time that we have marked Exhibit 361, Mr. Chairman, I would
like to use the next number in sequence, No. 362 to mark the other half of this
same exhibit which is designated Texas School Book Depository floor plan of
the first floor, which we will not use at this time, but I would like to mark it
in sequence.</p>

<p>And at this time I ask that Commission Exhibits Nos. 359, 360, 361, and 362
be admitted into evidence.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. So ordered. Let those exhibits be admitted as part of the
evidence.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos.
359, 360, 361, and 362 were admitted into evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Worrell, you had told us that you heard a plea by Chief
of Police Curry for all witnesses to come forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you heard that plea on the 23d of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. It was on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action, if any, did you take in response to that request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I called on the phone to the Farmers Branch police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You called who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. The Farmers Branch police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I see. And what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I told them what I had seen and they said, "Well, stay
there and we will come and get you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they come and get you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you then tell the police what you had seen and heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I told a Lt. Butler what I had seen, and I don't know if&mdash;they
placed the call into the Dallas police and something like an hour later they
came to pick me up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make a statement or take an affidavit on what you had
seen and heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. To the Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes, sir. I made a statement and signed five of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will show you a paper which is marked Commission Exhibit
363 which purports to be an affidavit bearing your signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me ask you first of all if that is your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you take just a minute, take your time and read
that affidavit over, please.</p>

<p>Have you had a chance to read that over, Mr. Worrell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you tell us that you signed five different statements or five
copies of the same statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Five copies of the same statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is this the statement which you signed in affidavit form at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As you have just&mdash;have you had time to read it over just now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that statement accurate based on your current recollection
of the event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. It is accurate down to, well, I changed my height to 5-8 from
5-7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from that minor variation, is it accurate in its entirety;
that is, is it all accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I left out, when I was making my affidavit, I left out, while
I was running I heard a gun fire two more times. Well, as I told you, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
turning the corner when I heard it and saw it fire the third time, and then the
fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, are there any other additions or modifications that you
would like to make from the contents of your statement in accordance with
your recollection at this moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I can't verify that&mdash;the time they got here because I am not
too sure of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are not sure of that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Are there any other modifications that you would want to make in the
contents of the statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Leave out firecracker. It sounded, it was too loud for a
firecracker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Your current recollection is that it was too loud for a firecracker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any other respect in which your current recollection
differs from this affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Instead of looking I ran, I looked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any other respect in which your current recollection
differs from the affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I left out on the barrel of the rifle, I left out part of the
stock. I didn't recollect that at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any other aspect in which your current recollection
differs from the facts set forth in this affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, everything else is O.K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the length of time between
the first shot and the last shot which you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. The best estimate 5, 6 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to, been interviewed by or given a statement
to any Federal agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. The FBI down at Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times have you seen the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect the names of the agents you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect when it was that you saw those agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. It was on that Saturday, the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where were you when you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. In the Dallas Police Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did that interview last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you sign a statement for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I just signed it for the Dallas police. They didn't have me
sign anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been interviewed by any other Federal agent or
representative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, Mr. Sorrels interviewed me when he called me and asked
me some questions when he called me up Wednesday night, I guess it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that in relationship to your coming here to this Commission
hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What sort of questions did Mr. Sorrels ask you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. What I saw. And I told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that just on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did that conversation last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Not very long. He talked to my mother first. He talked to
her for 15 minutes, something like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he talking to her about what you saw or about travel arrangements
to get you here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I don't know. I was watching television, I didn't know even
who she was talking to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Aside from that conversation with Mr. Sorrels and
the interview you have had with the FBI, have you ever talked with any agent
or representative of the Federal Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any police official of Dallas or the State of
Texas after you gave this affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on seeing only the back of this man, were you ever able to
make any identification of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chairman, I move for the admission into evidence of the
other exhibit which we have used with Mr. Worrell being Commission Exhibit
No. 362.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The exhibit will be admitted to evidence.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 362 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That concludes our questions.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You stated that, I believe, you looked up after you had heard
the first report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You looked up and saw the barrel of a rifle, and then the
rifle fired. What made you know that it fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How did you know it was fired when you were looking at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Well, I saw what you might call a little flame and smoke.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You saw something that came out of the barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were you looking at it when you heard the third report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir, looking at it, turning around and started to run.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see anything then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Same thing, a little flash of fire and then smoke. I didn't see
it on the fourth one.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you only look at the car in which the President was riding
one time when you said you saw him slump?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you look back at the President's car then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir. I didn't do that because I mean I didn't know if there
was one or more guns, because I wondered why if it was in such rapid succession
being a bolt action, I found out later, and I didn't know what was coming off, so
I was running to the back of the building because I figured that would be the
safest place.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see anyone in the windows, in the Texas Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you notice where this man you have described later as
running away from the building, did you see him come out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. At the back entrance. Approximately where I put the
mark "Z."</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was he running all the time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Yes, sir, he sure was.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Prior to hearing the first shot, had you looked up at the School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir; I sure didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to observe the direction of the barrel which you
have described?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. Pointing right down at the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any special part of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I mean, I couldn't really say that because it was too high up
and he could have been pointing at anyone of the cars. I mean I couldn't tell
from where I was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it on the part of the motorcade which had turned down
Elm Street or on the part of the motorcade that was still on Houston or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. It was the part that was turned down Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Worrell, we have a report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
which contains a purported interview with you, designated as report of
Robert P. Gemberling dated November 30, 1963, which has this statement:</p>

<p>"He"&mdash;referring to you&mdash;"stated that last night when he saw photographs of
Lee Harvey Oswald on television he felt this was the person he had seen running
away from the building. He stated this person did not look back but he was
certain this was a white person since he had a profile view."</p>

<p>My question, first of all, to you: Did you have a profile view of the man who ran
away from the building that you described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The second question is, did you tell the FBI that you had a
profile view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir, I sure didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you tell the FBI agent who interviewed you, that you felt
that this person was Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. I don't know if I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anyone else leave the building, that is the Texas
School Book Depository Building, except the man you have already described
to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worrell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Are there any further questions? I believe we will stand
in recess until 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="ale"><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF AMOS LEE EUINS</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:15 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>Amos, will you stand up, please, and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before this Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be seated. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Sixteen.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, should we start by reading the purpose?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. I think you received a copy of this statement. But
I just want to say to you that the purpose of today's hearing is to hear the
testimony of Arnold Louis Rowland, James Richard Worrell, Robert H. Jackson,
and yourself who were in the vicinity of the assassination scene on November
22, 1963. The Commission proposes to ask you facts concerning your
knowledge of the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>You understand that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you tell us your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Amos Lee Euins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your exact date of birth, Amos?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. January 10, 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. January 10, 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you a school boy at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What school do you go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What grade are you in at that school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. The ninth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you live with your parents, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How is your health generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I guess it is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How are your eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. They are all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you see good at a distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, I can see good at a distance, but I can't see at real close
range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to read without glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You don't use glasses for any purposes, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say you have trouble at close range, just what do
you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. You know, like I put something on real close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating about 4 or 5 inches from your eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. And then they kind of get dim. But on a long scene,
I can see good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How are your grades in school, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. They are all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are they better than average, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. They are about average.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Going back to November 22, 1963, that is last year, Amos, do you recall what
you were doing early on that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. When I first got up, I went to school. Then about
11:30, well, the teachers called us and told us the ones that wanted to go
downtown to see the President come down to the office and get an excuse and
they could go. So I went down to the office, and I got an excuse, so I went
downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what time did you leave school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you go from your school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What part of downtown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Right over by the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the names of those streets, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If I told you they were Elm and Houston, would that help your
memory as to what the names of those streets were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It was right by the freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Let me show you a photograph, Amos, which is on a
document I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 365.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 365 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Take just a minute and look at that, and see if you can recognize
where that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. This is going across the railroad tracks, back up to here&mdash;right
here at the corner is the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is the Book Depository Building, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Why don't you just put an "X" with this pencil on the Book Depository Building,
as you identify it there, Amos&mdash;on the building itself.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you somewhere in that area when the President's
motorcade went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why don't you take this black pencil and put an "A" right where
you were, Amos.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what time did you get to the place where you have marked
with an "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Oh, I would say around about 15 minutes or something like that
to 12, because my mother brought me down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. She drove you down, did she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you with anybody when you came to that spot, or
did your mother leave you off there by yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. She left me. She had to go on to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, about how long was it after you got there that the motorcade
came by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Oh, I would say about&mdash;I had been there about 15, maybe 20
minutes. It come around the corner, come on around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Amos, I want to show you another picture here that I have marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 366.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 366 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I ask you if you can recognize what that building is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. This here is the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, look back over here at 365. Can you tell us which direction the President's
motorcade came from on this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It come from right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. First of all, do you know what the name of this street is?
Would that be Main Street, in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Coming down Main Street, indicating in a general westerly
direction. Turning which way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. This way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Turned right.</p>

<p>Do you know if that is Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show the witness is identifying a street heretofore
identified as Houston.</p>

<p>Then which way did the motorcade go after proceeding in a general northerly
direction on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It come this way, turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which way&mdash;right or left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It turned to the left, coming down, going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the name of the street it turned onto when it made
the left turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was just trying to keep an eye on the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The witness has identified a street heretofore identified as Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Tell us what you saw as the motorcade went by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was standing here on the corner. And then the President come
around the corner right here. And I was standing here. And I was waving, because
there wasn't hardly no one on the corner right there but me. I was waving.
He looked that way and he waved back at me. And then I had seen a pipe, you
know, up there in the window, I thought it was a pipe, some kind of pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When had you first seen that thing you just described as a pipe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Right as he turned the corner here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, exactly where did you see that thing you have described as
a pipe come from. And take a good look now before you tell us where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you mark an "X" on Exhibit No. 366 where you saw
the pipe? Mark the exact window, if you can, Amos.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Proceed to tell us what happened, Amos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the corner,
I was facing, looking dead at the building. And so I seen this pipe thing sticking
out the window. I wasn't paying too much attention to it. Then when the first
shot was fired, I started looking around, thinking it was a backfire. Everybody
else started looking around. Then I looked up at the window, and he shot again.
So&mdash;you know this fountain bench here, right around here. Well, anyway, there
is a little fountain right here. I got behind this little fountain, and then he shot
again.</p>

<p>So after he shot again, he just started looking down this, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who started looking down that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. The man in the window. I could see his hand, and I could see his
other hand on the trigger, and one hand was on the barrel thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, at the time the second shot was fired, where were you looking then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was still looking at the building, you know, behind this&mdash;I was
looking at the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Looking at anything special in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. I was looking where the barrel was sticking out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many shots did you hear altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I believe there was four, to be exact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, where were you looking at the time of the third shot, if you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. After he shot the first two times, I was just standing back here.
And then after he shot again, he pulled the gun back in the window. And then
all the police ran back over here in the track vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Slow down just a little bit in what you are telling us.</p>

<p>When the second shot occurred, were you still standing at the point where you
marked with an "A" on 365?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. But I was right behind this <span class="locked">little&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you a little bit behind of where that "A" is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; right back here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let's mark that with a "B," where you were at the time the
second shot occurred.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, when the third shot occurred, Amos, let me ask you again, where were
you looking then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was still down here, looking up at the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you see in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I seen a bald spot on this man's head, trying to look out the
window. He had a bald spot on his head. I was looking at the bald spot.
I could see his hand, you know the rifle laying across in his hand. And I could
see his hand sticking out on the trigger part. And after he got through, he
just pulled it back in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him pull it back in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you still standing at point B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When he pulled it back in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was still behind here, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you when you heard what you described as the
fourth shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. The first shot I was standing here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now you are referring to 366. Put an "L" on 366 where you
were standing at the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. And then as I looked up there, you know, he fired another shot,
you know, as I was looking. So I got behind this fountain thing right in
there, at this point B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At point B on 365?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I got behind there. And then I watched, he did fire again. Then
he started looking down towards my way, and then he fired again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The question I have for you now is where were you when he
fired on that fourth time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was still behind point B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were still at point B when he fired the fourth time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. Then he pulled the gun back in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him pull the gun back in the window after the fourth
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes; he just come back like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you watch what he did after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; because after he had pulled it back in the window, I
ran this way, and went across the tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You start on Exhibit 365, and put the black mark and show us the path of
where you ran on 365.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was here at "B."</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I was coming down like this here, and there was a policeman, you
know there is a little cut you can come through there. There was a policeman
standing right around here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was the policeman standing? Mark that with point "C,"
Amos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Right there.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You ran past the policeman standing at point C?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir. You see, I come from point B, and ran here, and told
the policeman I had seen the shot, because they were looking at the railroad
tracks. So he put me on the cycle and he went to here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He put you on the cycle and took you where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Up to the front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; and then he called some more cars. They got all around
the building. And then the policemen came from the tracks, and they got
around the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see the policemen come from the tracks to go around
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how many policemen were there, would you say, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. There was about 14 or something like that. They were coming
from the tracks here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what the name of that policeman was, who was
in that position where you have marked C?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir. He was kind of an old policeman. I ran down and got
him. And he ran up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. The Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Then he called some more cars. They got all the way around the building.
And then after that, well, he seen another man. Another man told him he seen
a man run out the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who that man was who said somebody ran out the
back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir. He was a construction man working back there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you there when the man talked about somebody running
out the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. He said the man had&mdash;he said he had kind of bald spot
on his head. And he said the man come back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what the name of the man was who told the police
that someone had run out the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. . No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. So then they took me over to the county jail. And that is where
I told them what happened. And then they was standing around the Book Depository
Building, and I stayed over there to the jailhouse about 6 o'clock. And
then they took me home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did they question you about what happened and what you
observed on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. At the jailhouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the jailhouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Amos, would you tell us everything that you can remember about what you
saw about the gun itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Well, when I first got here on the corner, the President was
coming around the bend. That is when&mdash;I was looking at the building then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you think it was when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I thought it was a piece of pipe or something sticking out the
window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did it look like it was a piece of metal to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; just a little round piece of pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About an inch in diameter, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long was the piece of pipe that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It was sticking out about that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About 14 or 15 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. And then after I seen it sticking out, after awhile, that
is when I heard the shot, and everybody started looking around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At that time, Amos, did you see anything besides the end of
the pipe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For example, you didn't see anything about a stock or any
other part of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir&mdash;not with the first shot. You see, the President was still
right along down in here somewhere on the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, when you saw it on the first occasion, did you think it was
a rifle then? Or did that thought enter your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I wasn't thinking about it then. But when I was looking
at it, when he shot, it sounded like a high-powered rifle, after I listened to it
awhile, because I had been in the NDCC for about a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is NDCC?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. We call it a military army for the boys, at our school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that ROTC?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. ROTC. And have you had any opportunity to fire a weapon
in that ROTC class?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; not outside of just .22's. We fire them on the firing
range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, when you looked up at the rifle later, you described seeing some of
the trigger part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, describe as fully as you can for us what you saw then,
Amos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Well, when he stuck it out, you know&mdash;after the President had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
come on down the street further, you know he kind of stuck it out more, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far was it sticking out of the window would you say then,
Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I would say it was about something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating about 3 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. You know&mdash;the trigger housing and stock and receiver group
out the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I can't understand you, Amos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It was enough to get the stock and receiving house and the trigger
housing to stick out the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The stock and receiving house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what direction was the rifle pointing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Down&mdash;what did you say&mdash;Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; down Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it pointing in the direction of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, could you see anything else on the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For example, could you see whether or not there was a telescopic
lens on the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is there anything else about the gun that you can describe
to us that you have not already told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what kind of a look, if any, did you have at the man who
was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. All I got to see was the man with a spot in his head, because
he had his head something like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating his face down, looking down the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; and I could see the spot on his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How would you describe that man for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I wouldn't know how to describe him, because all I could see
was the spot and his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he slender or was he fat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I didn't get to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you tell from where you looked whether he was tall or
short?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of what race was he, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I couldn't tell, because these boxes were throwing a reflection,
shaded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you tell whether he was a Negro gentleman or a white man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Couldn't even tell that? But you have described that he had
a <span class="locked">bald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Spot in his head. Yes, sir; I could see the bald spot in his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, could you tell what color hair he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you tell whether his hair was dark or light?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far back did the bald spot on his head go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I would say about right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating about 2½ inches above where your hairline is. Is
that about what you are saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you get a very good look at that man, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to tell anything about the clothes he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, when you were at the sheriff's department in the police
station that you have described, did they ask you to sign an affidavit or statement
for them, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now show you a paper, Amos, which I have marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 367.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 367 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This is supposed to be a statement which is signed. Let me first
point out to you that it is a copy of it. I ask you if this is a copy of your
signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, will you take your time, Amos, and read that over, and then I want
to ask you a couple of questions about it.</p>

<p>Did you have a chance to read it over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Let me ask you about a couple of specific things here, Amos.</p>

<p>In the statement you say here that he was a white man. By reading the
statement, does that refresh your memory as to whether he was a white man
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I told the man that I could see a white spot on his head,
but I didn't actually say it was a white man. I said I couldn't tell. But I saw
a white spot in his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Your best recollection at this moment is you still don't know
whether he was a white man or a Negro? All you can say is that you saw
a white spot on his head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, did you tell the people at the police station that he was a
white man, or did they make a mistake when they wrote that down here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. They must have made a mistake, because I told them I could see
a white spot on his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is there anything else in this statement, Amos, which is
different from the way you remember this event, as you are sitting here right
now?</p>

<p>Amos, did you understand the last question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you answer it for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I don't think there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I don't understand you, Amos. The question I am trying to
get at it, as you read that statement over now, you have testified or told us
here today what you remember about this assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I am asking you, when you read that statement over, is
there anything on that statement which you think is wrong, based on what
you remember right now?</p>

<p>For example, you told us that they were wrong when they wrote down that
you identified him as a white man. Were they wrong about anything else
that they wrote down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Not that I can see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>When you looked up and saw this man, Amos, did he have on a hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any boxes behind him at that time, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; there were some boxes, you know, all the side of the
window. Like this window&mdash;there were some boxes in these windows up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You saw some boxes in these windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. In these windows, and these windows, and there was boxes in
half of this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Now, mark the windows where you saw those boxes, Amos. Start off with&mdash;mark
the window "Y" where you saw boxes.</p>

<p>(Witness marking.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You made a figure 9, as I read it, on the two places you saw
boxes in the windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; in this half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were there boxes in the window marked "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir. There were about two or three of them right along
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the middle dividing line there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that window marked "X" opened, Amos, or closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far open was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. About that high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating about 19 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the window in the other double window immediately
next to the window marked "X" open or closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. The top window, on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am referring to the window right next to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; it was not open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Amos, when you heard the first shot, did you have any reaction
or impression as to where the noise was coming from at that exact time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; not at the exact time. You know, because everybody else
started looking around. So I just started looking around, thinking it was a
backfire, just like everyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you look up towards that window before the second shot,
or just when the second shot occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I think&mdash;just a little before, because as soon as I did, I looked at
it&mdash;pow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You heard a pow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as you were watching and heard, did you have the impression
that the noise you heard was coming from that rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I didn't, because I wasn't thinking of the rifle at first&mdash;you
know, because it looked like a pipe at first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say the second&mdash;when you heard the second shot, when
you say you were looking at the rifle, did you have the feeling that the noise
came from the rifle when you heard the second shot, when you were looking at
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, did you have any impression at all about where the noise
was coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir; not on the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you think the noise was coming from on the second
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I seen him shoot on the second shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So you thought the noise was coming from the rifle on the second
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did you say you thought, or saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. I saw him shoot the second shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How high were those boxes behind him, Amos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. They was probably about 2 feet high stacked in the back of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Amos, were you questioned later by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Yes, sir; over in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times were you questioned by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. Oh, once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you remember when that was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. It was around about 2 or 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you remember how many days after the assassination it
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. About 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You think they might have talked to you more than once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Euins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I move for the admission into evidence of the
statement marked Commission Exhibit 367.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 367 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That concludes the questioning I have, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Wright?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to move for the admission into
evidence of all the exhibits here&mdash;365, 366, as well as 367.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 365 and 366, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Amos, you may be excused, then. Thank you very much for
coming and helping us out with your testimony.</p>

<p>We will recess until tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.</p>

<h2 id="bwf">TESTIMONY OF BUELL WESLEY FRAZIER</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to assign Commission Exhibit No. 364 to a paper
sack which the FBI has identified as their C-109 Exhibit. That will be the
Commission's Exhibit No. 364 for identification at this time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(The paper sack referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 364
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Also for the record I would like to announce that prior to&mdash;this
morning, Mr. Cortlandt Cunningham and Charles Killion of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation laboratory, the Ballistics Division, Firearms Division, I guess
it is, broke down, that is unscrewed Commission Exhibit No. 139, an Italian
rifle, and that rifle has been placed in, after being disassembled, has been
placed in Commission's No. 364 for identification, that paper sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. She was there for, I believe, for a period of about 4 or 5 weeks
because my stepfather was with her and he got sick and they had to put him
in the hospital and he was in the hospital 3 or 4 weeks, somewheres, 4 or 5 weeks
because they were there a week before he got sick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then on November 21 and 22, living with you in this residence at

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. September of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work do you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I fill orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to get that job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I went to see, first I come up there and started looking
for a job and couldn't find one myself so I went to one of these employment
agencies and through that a lady called up one morning, I was fixing to go out
and look for one, I was looking for myself in the meantime when they were,
too, and so she called up and gave me a tip to it if I was interested in a job
like that I could go over there and see about that and for the time being I wasn't
working and needed some money and so I did and I went over there and saw
Mr. Truly, and he gave me an interview, and then he hired me the same day
I went over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you came up, you mean you came up from Huntsville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was in September 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Looking for a job around Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to live with your sister at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What&mdash;where is the employment agency and what is its name
when you first applied for a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I went to several but, see, this one got me this job the main
one was Massey, the employment agency, and it is over there on Shady Grove
Road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you spell that name, the name of the employment agency?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Massey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe it is M-a-s-s-e-y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was a woman at the employment agency that called you
and told you to go to see the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went to see Mr. Truly and after an interview he gave
you a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you started work there about what date in September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was the 13th. I say that was the same day I went for an
interview. I went early enough that morning that he told me to come back after
lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are still working there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When Mr. Truly hired you did he tell you it would be a full-time job
or just a temporary job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he told me that he was looking for somebody full time
and I told him, well, that is what I wanted, and so he said that would be just fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How much did he start to pay you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He started me off with a dollar and a quarter an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is for an eight-hour day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. Five days a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you commute back and forth from your sister's home in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Over there to the Texas School Books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the first day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you still do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you own a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your own car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had it, did you, when you started to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Still have it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have been since September driving that car from your
sister's home in Irving over to the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go there in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time do you get to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I get there around 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When do you quit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I quit at 4:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you drive home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do all the employees have the same lunch hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Now, the ones who work down there filling book orders around
where I work now, so we all work the same hours. Some people work up there
in the offices, I hear that they come in a little bit later. Now, I don't know for
sure but I see primarily the ones who does the same type of work I do, we all
start the same time and work the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Those are the people who fill the orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far is it in miles from your sister's home to Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is roughly around 15 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you take the same route every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You mean since I have been going over there; since the first day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Up to now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>You see, I found two ways, you can more judge by the traffic and you can go
some days one way and the traffic will be easier than others, but most times I
use just one route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What route did you usually use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Used one like you go down from the house there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Go down and right Storey Road, see Fifth Street is just one
block off Storey Road, and just go down and hit Storey Road and stay on it
until you come to Stemmons Freeway and you stay right on Stemmons until you
come right on into Dallas there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what length of time does it take you to go from your sister's
home to work in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Usually, I usually leave not any later than 7:25. I usually try
to leave about 7:20, and if you leave at 7:20, you usually get around there, by
the time you get down to the parking lot now it is usually pretty close to 5 minutes
to 8 and that gives you enough time to walk to the Book Depository, put up your
lunch and take off your coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have a place to park your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it assigned to you by Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he just said we had a parking lot there and showed me
where it was and said you can park in the parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that the parking lot two or three blocks from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir, it is down there; right across from the warehouse there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you would walk from there from that parking <span class="locked">lot&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Up to the other Depository up there at the corner of Houston
and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have here a map which has been marked as Commission's Exhibit
No. 361.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And north is to the bottom of the map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Instead of the top, as usually the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It has two pictures over here, one to the left and one to the right of
the map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take a look at the picture to the right of the map. Do you
recognize that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I see that is right there where you say that is the street going
up to the parking lot there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize this car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What car is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is my car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that where you usually park every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I would say at the time being when I first started to work
there I first started to park there but now I park on the other side of the fence
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But that is a picture of the parking lot, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where you park is in the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. I park inside the fence but what I am talking about&mdash;I
park on the different side of the lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Different side of the same lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; we just have one lot there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you see the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you walked from about the place where your car is parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Usually up to the Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the map to the left, upper left-hand corner of the map, there
is a picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you see this area where I point my finger which is marked
"parking lot No. 1."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is the same parking lot we were looking at right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What route do you walk, which way do you walk when you park
in this parking lot No. 1, to the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Do you want me to get up to where I can show it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; show it to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I usually always come up, you know, you can come right, you
see the building right down here, and you notice a series of railroad tracks, so
usually early in the morning, now about 8 o'clock there is usually not any cars
right here, but I say they are switching back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By "cars" you mean railroad cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; they usually start switching around 8 o'clock. Usually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
there are not any cars, it is usually a long train that moves up pretty soon but
I usually move up in this direction here, especially when it is dry. When it is
wet I walk on this because it is harder. But when it is raining, I usually walk
around here, because in this area right here, when you get up closer to the railroad
tracks it has more trenches, and it gets muddy and slimy and you can get
bogged down.</p>

<p>So, when it is bad weather, I usually walk on this side. But I say nine times
out of ten I come up right down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's look at the map. Here is the parking lot here, is that the
parking lot where you usually park?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is parking lot No. 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is parking lot No. 1, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will show you this map later, but just to illustrate, how do you
usually, what is the route you usually take, just show us on the board here,
the route you usually take to the Texas School Book Depository Building in
the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You mean when I am coming off of the freeway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you park here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You know right here, you say like the car, you notice that little
house right there, I assume you have checked off. You know like I was telling
you now. I usually park over in this corner. But at the time I parked right
there. But anyway, there is a little cyclone fence and this was the series of
railroad tracks, I was talking to you about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I usually come down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Munger Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right, and usually cross along the railroad tracks and
come up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Houston runs into it, now they are doing some work across the
tracks and you can't go any further than the tracks, right along here this line,
cyclone, but that type of fence and I usually walk right up, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To the buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And enter the rear of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Now, we call it a loading zone out there, dock area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Did anyone else ride with you in the morning, usually did anyone else ride
with you in the morning from home to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody ride with you from work to home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you first hear of Lee Harvey Oswald, first hear the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I first heard, I never really did know his name, we just called
him Lee around there. But the first time I ever saw him was the first day he
come to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard he was coming to work before he came to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I will say, you know, talking back and forth with the bossman
all the time and from being around and getting along real fine and so he told me,
I assume the day after he hired him that he was going to have him come in on
Monday and he asked me had I ever seen him and I told him then no; I had
never seen him.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had your sister told you that this fellow Lee was coming to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; she did. She said one afternoon when I went home she
told me she found out from one of the neighbors there he came over for that
interview with Mr. Truly and Mr. Truly had hired him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard that from your sister?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, before I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you first saw him was it a Monday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any idea of the date itself, do you have any memory
of the date when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it sometime around the middle of October, do you think,
would that be close to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It could have been because it was sometime in October
because I remember I went to work there on the 13th and I had been
working there, 4 or 5 weeks and then he come there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I first saw him he was&mdash;we have a table not as large as this,
but just about half as large as this, and we have just like you walk up to
it where I am sitting over here and we have four or five boxes there and
we have different names on it, you know, for different publishing companies,
and he was there getting some orders, and I say, as well as I remember, I
said, the foreman there was getting him out some real easy orders. Some
of the orders we have are real easy to fill, easier than the others, you don't
have to know so much about the textbooks to be able to fill them and he
was getting some of them easy ones out to start on, when we have a great
number of them, you see, the little pamphlet type books and all we do is
count them out and read the invoice number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the name of the foreman showing him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You mean the foreman, that was Mr. Shelly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. S-h-e-d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. S-h-e-l-l-y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Shelly.</p>

<p>What floor was this on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was on the first floor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Shelly introduce you to him or did you go up and shake
hands with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't. I remember, I knew, you know that he
was going to be coming to work so naturally I hadn't been there very long,
you know, living in Dallas and so I wanted to make friends with everybody
I could, because you know yourself friendship is something you can't buy
with money and you always need friends, so I went up and introduced
himself to myself, and he told me his name was Lee and I said "We are glad
to have you."</p>

<p>We got talking back and forth and he come to find out I knew his wife
was staying down there at the time with this other woman and so I thought
he would go out there and I said, "Are you going to be going home this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>And he told me then, he told me that he didn't have a car, you know, and
so I told him, I said, "Well, I live out there in Irving,"&mdash;I found out he
lived out there and so I said, "Any time you want to go just let me know."</p>

<p>So I thought he would go home every day like most men do but he told
me no, that he wouldn't go home every day and then he asked me could he
ride home say like Friday afternoon on weekends and come back on Monday
morning and I told him that would be just fine with me.</p>

<p>I told him if he wanted a ride any other time just let me know before I
go off and leave him because when it comes to quitting time some of these
guys, you know, some of them mess around the bathroom and some of them
quit early and some of them like that and some leave at different times than
others.</p>

<p>But I said from talking to him then, I say, he just wanted to ride home
on weekends with me and I said that was fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say at that time he was living in Dallas, he had a room
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; he did. He had an apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't. He just said he had an apartment over
in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you known his wife before that? Had you ever met
his wife, Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I never had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard that a Russian girl was staying there in the
neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say about this time I met him, you know, I knew that
at the time then but I didn't think anything about it because, you know, the
people travel from one country to the next all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know Mrs. Paine, Ruth Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't until all this had happened because I will be
frank with you, people around there, I say, they just don't make friends
very easy. I say you can have somebody living three doors from you and
you can live a couple of years and you still might not know the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had never met Mrs. Ruth Paine before the day you
met Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did Lee do, what kind of work was assigned
to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He filled orders like I do and several other men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many order fillers were there employed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, I would say roughly around five, six at that time. Because
about the time we was real busy, the busy season. I come there, you
know, and they was going pretty good when I went to work there and I say
we were still going pretty good when he come to work there.</p>

<p>We had a lot of work to do and usually when we have a lot of work to
do we have more order fillers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ride home with you in your car on weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Friday nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From that time until November 22, did he ride home with you
every weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he did every weekend but one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the statement you made I believe you said it was the 16th
and 17th of November. I am just reminding you of that.</p>

<p>Does it refresh your memory any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I remember one weekend, I say, right now I can't recall
because just to be frank with you I couldn't tell you roughly; I say I
might have at that time but I say it slipped my mind but the thing is I do
know he rode home with me every weekend up to that but one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And why did&mdash;did he tell you why he wasn't going to ride home
that weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, he did. He said he was working on his driving license
and he was going to go take a driving test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever ask him afterward if he had taken his driver's
test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I never did. I assumed that he had taken it and
passed it what part of the test he was taking.</p>

<p>Most men do, I say, they usually work at it, study at it good enough so
they don't flunk out.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you have to get a learner's permit in Texas before
you can get a driver's permit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I say, you don't. Just two steps to it. I say, first
no matter what age you are; say, when you have to be at least 14 is about the
youngest you can get it in Texas and then you have to take a DE, Driver's
Education, if you are going to school but otherwise, the age is 16 and you just go
around to the driving license bureau there, they have an office in most any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
town of any size in Texas, and you just go in and see the driving license man
and just tell him that you plan to take your driving test and you would
like to have the auto manual, and the manual covers any laws and so forth
in the State of Texas, and you can either study for your operator's or your
commercial and you pick out which one you want, and you study up for it and
then he is there, he tells you what days he is in his office, and so he goes there
a certain time and he gives you several sheets of paper, a quiz and you
answer them questions, and if you&mdash;you have to make a grade of 70 on it
to pass and if you make a grade of 70 or above, well, I say, in another week
or two you go down there and you say like for instance if you are going to
want a driver's license for a <span class="locked">car&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Lee ever ask you or did Lee ever tell you whether
he had ever actually applied for a driver's license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he never had, except I told you that weekend that
he said he was going down to take his driving test, and so I knew from being in
the State of Texas that you have to know something; you have to have the
manuals and so forth to study up on it. Or there isn't any use going down
there if you don't know the rules because you are not wasting any time but
your own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether or not one weekend that he didn't
go down with you but he rode back with you, say, on the Armistice Day
holiday? Do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your memory is that he went, he rode home with you every
Friday and came back the following Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Except this one weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, that is what I say. If he went home with me on
Friday afternoon he always rode back with me on Monday morning. It
wasn't no added job when he would come with me on the weekend. He
would ride home with me on Friday and he would come back with me on
Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever tell you that he had or had not applied for a
driver's license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; he had not except he told me he was going down to
take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He never told you that he had or had not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he never told you whether he had obtained a driver's
license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to him on whether or not he could drive a
car, knew how to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, I believe the first afternoon, the first time we
was going home and we were talking about that and he said he was working
on his driving license then, and then naturally like I told you several weeks
later, then he told me he was going to take his driving test and I assumed
he could drive a car being as old as he was because most everybody in
the State of Texas by the time you are my age if you can't drive a car something
is wrong with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He did never say whether he could or couldn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever ask you about the parts of a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember any conversation when he asked you what
the clutch was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes. We got talking about that. He noticed, you know,
most cars as old as mine, you know most of them are standard shift, and when
I bought this old car it kind of fooled me it had automatic transmission on
it so we got talking about it on the way home driving home and I told him
that I really prefer a standard because you know, they are a lot easier to work
on and you know, when an automatic goes dead it goes dead, there is no rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
a couple of feet and jumping on the clutch and starting when the battery is
down.</p>

<p>And I remember he said it was a little bit different to drive with a clutch.
I said, if you are not used to it, but if you get used to it. You have to find a
friction point on any car, even on Chevrolet or Ford, you know yourself the
friction points on a clutch and the brakes are different adjusted on every car you
drive.</p>

<p>And I told you there is nothing you do. You just have to get used to a car of the
individual, you can drive one car to do it, and you can drive another one it
may take you a couple of days to get used to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He is the one who mentioned the clutch, is he, that you didn't
have a clutch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>I guess he noticed that I didn't have a clutch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Did he pay for any part of the trip, buy your gasoline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't. I never did ask him. Because like I said
I drove over there anyway and it doesn't take any more to drive one guy than
it does to drive a carload.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he offer to pay any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At any time coming back after a weekend did you ever stop at
a restaurant for breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; we never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever stop on the way home on Friday night and buy
anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; stopped one time and bought some gas, I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he pay for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he offer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him have any money in his possession, bills,
change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I never did see him out playing around with any
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the way back and forth did you talk very much to each other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; not very much. He is, probably in your line of business
you have probably seen a lot of guys who talk a lot and some don't and
he was one of these types that just didn't talk. And I have seen, you know, I am
not very old but I have seen a lot of guys in my time, just going to school,
different boys and girls, some talk a lot and some don't, so I didn't think anything
strange about that.</p>

<p>About the only time you could get anything out of the talking was about babies,
you know, he had one and he was expecting another, that was one way he had
him get that job because his wife was pregnant and I would always get something
out of it when I asked him about the babies because it seemed he was
very fond of children because when I asked him he chuckled and told me about
what he was doing about the babies over the weekend and sometimes we
would talk about the weather, and sometimes he would go to work and it
would be cloudy in the morning and it would come out that afternoon after
work, sometimes during the day and it would turn to be just one of the prettiest
days you would want anywhere, and he would say some comment about that,
but not very much.</p>

<p>He would say a few words and then he would cut off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you he had been to Russia, say anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, we were talking about one time talking about the
service, and so I asked him had he ever been overseas and he said he had, and
I asked him had he ever been to Germany and he said he had been through
there.</p>

<p>So, most times when boys are in the service in the United States they either
go to Japan or, I say, they either go over there or you know, go to some of
these, say, like Germany or France somewhere like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
And so other than that he told me that he had been through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say he had been to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He said, you know, like I say, he said he had been over there
and he said he had been there so I thought when he told me, yes; he had, so I
thought maybe, you know, by being, I know he told me had been in service and
I thought maybe that is how he got in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, your answer is yes; he did tell you he had been
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go into detail and tell you how he got there and what he
did there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, he didn't. I, to be frank with you I, was more interested
about France and Germany and I asked him about them towns and he told me
he liked France, I mean he said not that he didn't like France, he said people
in France was more the kind to con the United States boys out of their money
and he was in Germany there 2 or 3 days and he said he liked Germany better
than France because that is one reason. Because he said if you didn't really
know how to count that French money them French guys would really take
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything about being in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; he told me he was a Marine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That he had been to Japan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't say he had been to Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ever talk about politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ever mention any subjects like, political parties, the Democrats,
Republicans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ever mention anything about Communists, Marxists or any words
like that did he use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you where he met his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever talk much about his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't. I say, like I said, he was just a guy who
didn't talk very much at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the Texas School Book Depository, you have lunch, 45-minute
lunch hour, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pack your lunch from home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir, I always took lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether or not when Oswald came back with
you on any Monday morning or any weekend did he pack his lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. When he rode with me, I say he always brought lunch
except that one day on November 22 he didn't bring his lunch that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But every other day he brought a lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, when he rode with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would he bring it in a paper sack or what kind of a container?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; like a little paper sack you get out of a grocery store,
you have seen these little old sacks that you could buy, sandwich bag, sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you carry your lunch in a paper sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a lunch room in the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; on the second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is some kind of a recreation room on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There is a little domino room there where some of the guys go
in and play dominoes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But the lunch room is on the second floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do they sell any food there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; they don't. About all they sell in the lunch room is
different types of soft drinks and then near the window, the men who work
in the offices there they have coffee there, you can drink coffee up there, I never
did. Then you have an assortment of cookies and candies and peanuts and
so forth on the machine there. That is about all they have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether or not Oswald packed his lunch, brought
his lunch on other days, the days that he didn't ride with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To be frank with you, I don't know whether he brought his lunch
because I will tell you one way, some guys bring their lunch there and some guys
buy it there because we have a caterer service, you see, comes around about 10
o'clock the man comes around and several of the boys they go out there and buy
their lunch from the catering service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then later on at 11:45?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 12 o'clock is when we always eat lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 12 to 12:45?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you get off your job, did you usually go to the lunch room
on the second floor to eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; most of the time I don't. Most of the time you see several
of us guys sitting down at our own table and we just sit there. I say we
usually go up there to get something to drink and I say I have ate up there
several times but most of the times I eat with the guys I work with.</p>

<p>Usually we just sit down and eat, and we lay down on the big tables there
and sometimes talk or go to sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice where Oswald had his lunch usually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Now, I say we have a refrigerator there, some of the boys put their lunches in
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever eat lunch with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him eating lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I never have seen him eat lunch. I have seen him go
to the Doctor Pepper machine by the refrigerator and get a Doctor Pepper but
I never have seen him, you might say, sit right down and eat his lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In driving back and forth with Oswald did you ever hear him&mdash;did
he ever talk about guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever tell you he owned a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald ever say anything to you about buying an automobile
in any of these trips?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. One time we were talking about it, he said he thought he would
just buy him an old car, you know, like mine. I say most models like that you
can get them pretty cheap and as far as going back and forth for work that is
about all they are good for.</p>

<p>I said, "You don't need a new car to be used for going back and forth. You
don't need it unless you drive a good-sized distance."</p>

<p>But that is what he said in the long run he planned to buy one but so far as I
know he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say that once or more than once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; just one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he said he would get an old car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever tell you he had gone to an old car dealer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever tell you he had tried out a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. So far as I&mdash;like I say, that one time, that is as far
as I can ever recall that we even talked much about anything&mdash;about cars&mdash;except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
a while ago he asked me&mdash;we were talking about the clutch and automatic transmission
and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a bus service between Dallas and Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you get the bus anywhere near the Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To be frank with you I will say I have never ridden the bus from
Irving over there, but I assume you can get off there just like any other bus at
any street corner you want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what the fare is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there a toll charge to call from Dallas to Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For 10 cents you can call there, can you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say just for your regular telephone bill, you just pick
it up and call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Now, there was the one date that Oswald came to you and asked you to drive
him back to Irving, it was not a Friday, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; it wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was on a Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that the 21st of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, we were standing like I said at the four-headed
table about half as large as this, not, quite half as large, but anyway I was
standing there getting the orders in and he said, "Could I ride home with you
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Sure. You know, like I told you, you can go home with me any
time you want to, like I say anytime you want to go see your wife that is all
right with me."</p>

<p>So automatically I knew it wasn't Friday, I come to think it wasn't Friday
and I said, "Why are you going home today?"</p>

<p>And he says, "I am going home to get some curtain rods." He said, "You
know, put in an apartment."</p>

<p>He wanted to hang up some curtains and I said, "Very well." And I never
thought more about it and I had some invoices in my hands for some orders and
I walked on off and started filling the orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This was on what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This was on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say sometime between eight and ten, because I go to
work at eight and I would break at ten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it at the break time or before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was before the break.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was before noon then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him at the noon hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I don't recall, to be frank with you. You know, I will just be
frank with you, I say just like after a guy works there for a while and he comes
by and he walks by you, you don't pay so much attention but say like somebody
else comes in there strange, you automatically just look at them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to him again until quitting time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, to be frank with you, like I said, the only time&mdash;you know,
like I say, he didn't talk very much and about the only time&mdash;other than like I
told you about talking about them babies and about the weather sometimes he
would ask me some questions about a book because down there, I say, if you
have ever been acquainted with books a lot of times maybe just a little bit of
difference in a title or something like that would make the difference in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
type of book they want and sometimes maybe they will forget to put that on
there and you look at the price.</p>

<p>If you can tell the price, some editions we have a paperback and some we have
hard bound and the price can automatically tell you which one they want,
and sometimes he would ask me something like that which book do they want
and I would tell him and that was about the only conversation we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't talk any more with him that day concerning the ride
home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did go home with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is he rode home with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you get off from work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 4:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you get to Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, usually get there, if you make good time, get there maybe
around 5:20 or 5:25. But if you catch the traffic and catch the train crossing
the tracks, it is usually about 5:30 or 5:35, it is just according to how bad the
traffic is.</p>

<p>If you get ahead of it before it starts coming out, you can make pretty good
headway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make any stop in the car before you got home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the two of you walk together down to the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you dropped him off at the place where his wife was staying,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I did. I, to be frank with you I, say sometimes
he rode home with me, sometimes&mdash;a little store not too far from the house,
there and if I was going to the store I would just drop him off by the house,
but if I wasn't going to the store he would usually go on to the corner near the
house and walk the rest of the way to the house up to where his wife was
staying just about a half a block from my house up to where he was, his wife
was staying, so he would walk there just a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember if you talked to him any on the walk down two
or three blocks down to the parking lot, anything said that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got in the car and went home do you remember if you
said anything, if you said anything to him, or if he said anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe he did. Like I said, he didn't talk very
much. About the only time we would talk was about the weather and babies,
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember this day whether or not you let him walk to the
house where his wife was staying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To be frank with you, I can't remember positively whether I
let him off at the house or whether he got out there where I lived, just to be
frank with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know where the house is, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where Mrs. Paine lives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far is that from your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Like I say, it is just about half a block up the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is on the same street, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, we lived at the corner of Westbrook and Fifth
Street, and Fifth Street runs on up, you know, and I say they live on Fifth
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What direction does Fifth run, east, west, north or south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It runs east and west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. East and west. And you live on the corner of Westbrook and
Fifth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Paine's house is east or west of your house?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is west of of your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About a half block?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the same street. Fifth Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What side of the street do you live on, the north side or south side
of Fifth Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. North side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What side of the street do the Paine's live on, the north or south
side of Fifth Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. North.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You both live on the north side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So to walk from Paine's house to your house you walk east along
the north side of Fifth Street across Westbrook, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Now, from the corner of Westbrook and Fifth you walk west
on the same side of the street on the north side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the north side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From your house to Paine's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, you walk west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And from Paine's house to yours. OK.</p>

<p>Now, did you see Oswald any that night, the Thursday <span class="locked">night&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought him home.</p>

<p>Next morning what time did you get up? What time did you get up the next
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe I got up around 6:30, that is the time I usually get up,
right around 6:30 there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Always eat your breakfast before you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember the night before, that is after you got home that
night, that your sister asked you how it happened that Oswald came home with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I believe she did or something. We got to talking about
something and said, I told her that he had rode home with me and told her he
said he was going to come home and pick up some curtain rods or something.
I usually don't talk too much to my sister, sometimes she is not there when I am
in because she is either at the store or something like that and I am either when
she comes in as I say I am playing with the little nieces and we don't talk too
much about work or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This night, this evening, do you remember you did talk to her
about the fact that Oswald had come home with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell her what he had told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. I believe she said why did he come home now and I
said, well, he says he was going to get some curtain rods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The next morning you had breakfast about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Between 7 and 7:15, that is the time I usually, I usually come to
the breakfast table about 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Breakfast table in the kitchen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it is in the den.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the kitchen windows look out on what street, Westbrook or
Fifth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They look onto Westbrook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a back door, is there, to the kitchen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; there is. I say when we come in there we have a double
carport more or less type of garage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that on Westbrook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; the entrance to the garage there, more or less carport;
yes, the entrance is from Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you were having breakfast did your mother say anything to you
<span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I was sitting there eating my breakfast there, so sitting there,
I usually talk to my little nieces, you know, they have them cartoons on for a
while and we usually talk a little bit back and forth while eating breakfast
and I was just finishing my coffee there and my sister, you know, was working
over there around, you know the sink there, and she was fixing my lunch so she
was somewhere around there over on the cabinets fixing the cabinets and mother
just happened to glance up and saw this man, you know, who was Lee looking in
the window for me and she said, "Who is that?"</p>

<p>And I said, "That is Lee," and naturally he just walked around and so I thought
he just walked around there on the carport right there close to the door and so
I told her I had to go, so I went in there and brushed my teeth right quick and
come through there and I usually have my coat laying somewhere on the chair
and picked it up and put it on and by that time my sister had my lunch, you know,
in a sack and sitting over there on the washer where I picked it up right there
by the door and I just walked on out and we got in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did your sister say anything as you were having breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; she didn't say anything to me at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She didn't say anything to you either about Oswald or did she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; say, she didn't say, you know, when I looked up and saw
him I knew who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He just looked through the kitchen window. To see from there
on the ground outside there. I say you don't have to be any height at all, you
don't have to be too tall to be able to look in the kitchen window there.</p>

<p>I say, if you have the window open you can see in, if you have light on in
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When your mother mentioned, "Who is that," you looked up and saw
Lee Oswald in the kitchen window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I just saw him for a split second and when he saw I saw him, I
guess he heard me say, "Well, it is time to go," and he walked down by the back
door there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When he would go with you on Monday, on any Monday,
was this the same procedure for getting to, getting in contact with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You mean coming in there and looking through the window?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; it wasn't. I say, that is the first time he had ever done
that. I say, most times I would usually call him, you know, I was already out in
the car fixing to go out the driveway there, and, you know, around to pick him up
if he hadn't come down but most times, once in a while I picked him up at the
house and another time he was already coming down the sidewalk to the house
when I was fixing to pick him up and I usually picked him up around the corner
there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did this different method of him meeting you raise any
questions in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; it didn't. I just thought maybe, you know, he just left
a little bit earlier but when I looked up and saw that the clock was, I knew I
was the one who was running a little bit late because, as I say, I was talking,
sitting there eating breakfast and talking to the little nieces, it was later than I
thought it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went out the back door where was Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He was standing just a few feet there outside the back door
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He wasn't in the car?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he near the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he wasn't.</p>

<p>You see, always I keep my car parked outside the carport there, on the other
side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was just a few feet outside your back door when you came
out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you walk together to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you got in one side and he got in the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. Right in front there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say usually you had to go by and pick him up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I said I had a couple of times. Most of the time, you
know, he was usually walking down the sidewalk as I was driving out of the
driveway so, therefore, I didn't have to go up to the house there to pick him up.
I just usually picked him up around the corner because he was usually on the
sidewalk and I just stopped and picked him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you later than usual that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe we were, because we got to work on time.
I say, when I looked at the clock, after I glanced he was there a split second
and I just turned around and looked at the clock to see what time it was and
it was right around 7:21 then and I went in and brushed my teeth real quick
and running through the house put my coat on and we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You both got in the car about the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>When you got in the car did you say anything to him or did he say anything
to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Let's see, when I got in the car I have a kind of habit of
glancing over my shoulder and so at that time I noticed there was a package
laying on the back seat, I didn't pay too much attention and I said, "What's
the package, Lee?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Curtain rods," and I said, "Oh, yes, you told me you was going
to bring some today."</p>

<p>That is the reason, the main reason he was going over there that Thursday
afternoon when he was to bring back some curtain rods, so I didn't think any
more about it when he told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did the package look like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I will be frank with you, I would just, it is right as
you get out of the grocery store, just more or less out of a package, you have
seen some of these brown paper sacks you can obtain from any, most of the
stores, some varieties, but it was a package just roughly about two feet long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was, what part of the back seat was it in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was in his side over on his side in the far back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How much of that back seat, how much space did it take up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say roughly around 2 feet of the seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the side of the seat over to the center, is that the way you
would measure it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. If, if you were going to measure it that way from the end of
the seat over toward the center, right. But I say like I said I just roughly
estimate and that would be around two feet, give and take a few inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How wide was the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I would say the package was about that wide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How wide would you say that would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, say, around 5 inches, something like that. 5, 6 inches or
there. I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The paper, was the color of the paper, that you would get in a
grocery store, is that it, a bag in a grocery store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. You have seen, not a real light color but you know
normally, the normal color about the same color, you have seen these kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
heavy duty bags you know like you obtain from the grocery store, something
like that, about the same color of that, paper sack you get there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything more said about the paper sack on the way
into town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; there wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What route did you take into town that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Went down&mdash;you know, I told you I had two routes; that day
I went down, you know, Fifth Street runs into Sixth after you cross the Storey
Road there, so I just went on down Sixth until I come to O'Connor, and then
took a left on O'Connor and it takes you right on out to Stemmons and from
there I went right on into Stemmons and come up Commerce, and you go up
Commerce, there until you hit Record Street, that is one block over from Houston
and then I went down until I hit McKinney and then it goes right down
to the warehouse and then take a left and you go right around to the parking
lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't stop any place on your way in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Park in the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you park in the parking lot this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I parked in the same place the picture I showed you there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As shown in the picture. That is Exhibit No. 361.</p>

<p>Anything else said about curtain rods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; there wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything else said about the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; there wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who got out of the car first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember any conversation on the way in about anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I asked him did he have fun playing with them babies
and he chuckled and said he did. And so that morning I said just a few
minutes after we started you know it was a cloudy day and it started misting
and rain and by the time we got out on the Freeway I said, you know, how
those trucks throw that grime on the windshield and finally it was getting
pretty thick on there with spots of rain, and I turned on the windshield wiper
and you know how grime spatters your windshield and I said, "I wish it would
rain or just quit altogether, I wish it would do something to clear off the windshield,"
and the drops started getting larger so eventually it cleaned off the
windshield and by the time I got down to Dallas there I just turned off the
windshield.</p>

<p>Just a few clouds, and rained a little bit to get out of it. But other than
that just saying the weather was messy, that is about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it foggy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; not in too particular. I say in other words, just old
cloudy, dull looking day and like I say fine mist of rain and after we got a
little bit further we got into larger drops.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything said about the President coming to Dallas that
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; it wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything about that the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever have any conversation with him with reference to
the President's visit to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got to the parking lot who got out of the car first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't get out immediately then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I was sitting there, say, looked at my watch and somewhere
around 7 or 8 minutes until and I saw we had a few minutes and I sat
there, and as I say you can see the Freeway, Stemmons Freeway, from the
warehouse and also the trains coming back and forth and I was sitting there.</p>

<p>What I was doing&mdash;glanced up and watching cars for a minute but I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
letting my engine run and getting to charge up my battery, because when you
stop and start you have to charge up your battery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have your lunch beside you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice whether or not Lee had a package that looked
like a lunch package that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You know like I told you earlier. I say, he didn't take his
lunch because I remember right when I got in the car I asked him where was
his lunch and he said he was going to buy his lunch that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He told you that that day, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. That is right. So, I assumed he was going to buy it,
you know, from that catering service man like a lot of the boys do. They
don't bring their lunch but they go out and buy their lunch there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he do about the package in the back seat when he got
out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Like I say, I was watching the gages and watched the car for
a few minutes before I cut it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He got out of the car and he was wearing the jacket that has
the big sleeves in them and he put the package that he had, you know, that
he told me was curtain rods up under his arm, you know, and so he walked
down behind the car and standing over there at the end of the cyclone fence
waiting for me to get out of the car, and so quick as I cut the engine off and
started out of the car, shut the door just as I was starting out just like getting
out of the car, he started walking off and so I followed him in.</p>

<p>So, eventually there he kept getting a little further ahead of me and I
noticed we had plenty of time to get there because it is not too far from the
Depository and usually I walk around and watch them switching the trains
because you have to watch where you are going if you have to cross the tracks.</p>

<p>One day you go across one track and maybe there would be some cars sitting
there and there would be another diesel coming there, so you have to watch
when you cross the tracks, I just walked along and I just like to watch them
switch the cars, so eventually he kept getting a little further ahead of me and
by that time we got down there pretty close to the Depository Building there,
I say, he would be as much as, I would say, roughly 50 feet in front of me
but I didn't try to catch up with him because I knew I had plenty of time so
I just took my time walking up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you usually walk up there together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this the first time that he had ever walked ahead of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say he had the package under his arm when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean one end of it under the armpit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; he had it up just like you stick it right under your
arm like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he had the lower <span class="locked">part&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The other part with his right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He carried it then parallel to his body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, straight up and down.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Under his right arm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it look to you as if there was something heavy in the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I will be frank with you, I didn't pay much attention
to the package because like I say before and after he told me that it was curtain
rods and I didn't pay any attention to it, and he never had lied to me before
so I never did have any reason to doubt his word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it appear to you there was some, more than just paper he
was carrying, some kind of a weight he was carrying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, yes, sir; I say, because one reason I know that because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
I worked in a department store before and I had uncrated curtain rods when
they come in, and I know if you have seen when they come straight from the
factory you know how they can bundle them up and put them in there pretty
compact, so he told me it was curtain rods so I didn't think any more about
the package whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, from the way he carried it, the way he walked, did it appear
he was carrying something that had more than the weight of a paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, you know like I say, I didn't pay much attention
to the package other than I knew he had it under his arm and I didn't pay
too much attention the way he was walking because I was walking along there
looking at the railroad cars and watching the men on the diesel switch them
cars and I didn't pay too much attention on how he carried the package at
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you this picture again, this map, which is the Commission's
Exhibit No. 361, and would you show us the way he walked, the course
he walked from the place your car was parked up to the Texas School Book
Depository. You come around here and here is a black pen. Show us the course
that he walked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Like I say, I had that car parked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an "X" there which will represent your car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. All right (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is where your car was parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say roughly like in there, you know like the picture
shows right in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, draw a line to show the way that he walked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. O.K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The direction he walked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Like I say, he was standing right about there when I got out of the car so
naturally he started off walking so we just come on right on just like you would
come across these tracks right here, and he was coming right on along the
fence like that. Just coming right on, right here now is the School Book Depository,
right, so he was coming right on down this fence there and he was
coming across these tracks, and standing right in here somewhere at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the end of that put a "XY", so "X" to "XY" will represent
the course he walked. It shows "XY".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then "X" to "XY" is the course he took, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go in the same door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You walked the same direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now when he went in the door you were about 50 feet behind
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. The last time I saw him I was right in this area coming
across these railroad tracks and I just happened to glance up and see him
going through the door there and shut the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's see, the last time you saw him he was at the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which is at "XY" and you were crossing the railroad tracks on
Pacific Avenue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I say this is Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Pacific runs east and west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a mark there, put a "Z" there as to your location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is about where you were, a "Z" when he entered the door
at "XY"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you went on in the Building, did you, afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. I went on in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, the first floor of the Texas School Book Depository is fairly
clear, isn't it, it is clear of partitions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Pretty well. I will say we have bins after you get so far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Toward the middle of the floor you have bins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Lee as you walked in the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Commission 362 which we will show you. I will put it up
high so everyone can see it. There is a picture in the lower left corner which
is marked "Exterior View of Entrance Door from Houston Street Loading
Dock."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the door that Lee entered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is also the door that you entered, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And over to the right here is the interior view of entrance door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the same door, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Now, this door, you see right there is that door right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, the door in the lower left-hand corner is the outside
door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And as you walk through&mdash;and this is the door, the outside door, is
shown in the picture on the lower right-hand corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right, right there, that is this same door you are looking
at over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then there is an interior door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Leading into the interior that is also shown there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is sort of, what is it&mdash;a little corridor that you walk through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I say it is just about that distance from here over to that man
over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take a look there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is called the loading zone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This map shows certain steps up, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is the door that you entered or that he entered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the door. Is that covered, is that area covered with a
ceiling roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And this is also walled in, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. The railroad track runs along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you get into this outside shed how did you get into the first
floor of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Through that door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Through the door there, into the interior door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How much of the first floor here is clear so that you can see anybody
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Roughly say, let's see, just a few feet back, you know here is the
door right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whose door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Mr. Shelley's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Just a few feet back in here is where the bins start, they run this
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you mark in this where the bins start, the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just draw a line across, you don't need to draw in the bins but just
where the bins start and we we will know it is the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Somewhere right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Draw the line clear across.</p>

<p>We will mark the line "A" on one side and "B" on the other so that we can
refer to it.</p>

<p>Now, the area between, all the area shown in here from entrance to line "AB",
is clear, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the line from "AB" to the Elm Street side there are bins,
are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And are those bins man high?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 6, 7 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. Like I say these bins, we have two or three that run
across this way, like I have this line drawn, and they have broken spaces, and
you can see a man on the other side of these bins because they are not sealed up
in the back.</p>

<p>In other words, you can put books in, say, from this side and go on the other
side and have another. Anyway, we have more like these window here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The windows on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. We have some bins running this way, over here, several
bins, two or three over here, and two or three over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this the only entrance to the first floor of the Building, the one
you have shown us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir, it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What other entrance is there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right here is the main entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The main entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right, coming on through here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There are two entrances. There is a main entrance in the front
of the Building or the Elm Street entrance, and then there is the door through
which you entered the first floor, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, then we have another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Out over here, let's see if I can find it, where the garage where
we have the truck. Let's see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is an overhead door here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I see, right through here now, I see right through this door here
we come out right here and we come out in this area right in here where we
have another dock right out in this area right here, in that area there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That would be one, two, three. From this loading, like I say,
where we keep the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this overhead door usually covered, usually down closed, rather?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I say we keep it closed, and we have it here back in
cold weather and we kept it closed and like I say when you go out there and
get into the truck like you are going to drive the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark an arrow that you say is the entrance or exit, mark an
arrow going out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Going out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, this day did you see Lee Oswald the rest of the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I saw him back and forth, you know, that morning
walking around, filling books and so forth, filling orders, had invoices filling
orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you came in that morning to go to work where did you go
first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I went like I did every morning, I went down in the basement
there and hung up my coat and put up my lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Went down through the, now over there where they have&mdash;are
you familiar with the Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Only through the map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We have <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is the map of the first floor. Does it show the steps leading
down to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. You see the one there where you have the arrow that
is one entrance to the basement and that is the entrance I used the biggest part
of the time, that is the one I go down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. During the morning you say you saw Oswald around filling orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you on the sixth floor any that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. One time just a few seconds. I said to Mr. Shelley we had
some book returns. They had sent back and he told me to count the books and
make sure they were all there and put them in the space and so I took the
elevator and loaded them on with a two-wheeler and so I know where they
went, and I went to the shelf off the elevator and put them on the shelf and
turned around and went right on down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they doing some work there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. When I went to put up the stock?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes. On the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That was sometime between 8 and 10 o'clock. I say it was
the early part of the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did you notice they were doing up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. As well as I remember they were moving stock, I believe putting
up some stock, straightening up the stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any work done on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I don't remember if they were working on the floor or not.
They may have because upon the fifth floor I know we have done the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember the names of any workmen you saw on the sixth
floor that morning you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe Billy was up there, Billy Lovelady, but so far as I can
say I went and put books on the shelf and turned around and walked back and
glanced up when I was coming back, I didn't stay any length of time because
when we are pretty busy, some fill out orders and some doing something else
and if you have a lot of orders to fill you haven't got a lot of time to sit around
and be talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald on the sixth floor any time that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. I didn't because like I say that was the only time I
went up there at all that day and I was just up there for a few seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to him any that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I don't believe I did much unless he asked me something about
a book like I told you, and I was always willing to help anybody I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you knew that the President was going to pass that building
sometime that morning, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I heard he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to some of the men around there about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to Oswald about that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you knock off for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; not right then I didn't. I say, you know, he was
supposed to come by during our lunch hour so you don't get very many chances
to see the President of the United States and being an old Texas boy, and [he]
never having been down to Texas very much I went out there to see him and
just like everybody else was, I was standing on the steps there and watched
for the parade to come by and so I did and I stood there until he come by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went out there after you quit work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, for lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 12 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you hadn't eaten your lunch up to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go out there with somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you go out there with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I stayed around there pretty close to Mr. Shelley and this boy
Billy Lovelady and just standing there, people talking and just talking about
how pretty a day it turned out to be, because I told you earlier it was an old
cloudy and misty day and then it didn't look like it was going to be a pretty
day at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it turned out to be a good day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Pretty sunshiny day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Warm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it was pretty warm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then let's see, there was Billy Lovelady and you were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody else you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There was a lady there, a heavy-set lady who worked upstairs
there whose name is Sarah something, I don't know her last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you near the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I was, I was standing about, I believe, one step down
from the top there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One step down from the top of the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; standing there by the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By steps we are talking about the steps of the entrance to the
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Shown in this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which is Commission's Exhibit No. 362. Can you come over here
and show us about where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. Like I told you this was an entrance right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We have a bar rail running about half way up here. This was
the first step and I was standing right around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a mark there. Your name is Frazier, put an "F" there for
Frazier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. O.K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the picture that would show you about there, would it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; you can see, just see, the top, about the top rail there,
I was standing right in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To be frank with you, I say, shadow from the roof there knocked
the sun from out our eyes, you wouldn't have any glare in the eyes standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was a roof over your head, was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stand there for 30 minutes or&mdash;tell us how long you stayed
there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I stood there until the parade come by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President go by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, just right after he went by he hadn't hardly got by,
I heard a sound and if you have ever been around motorcycles you know how
they backfire, and so I thought one of them motorcycles backfired because right
before his car came down, now there were several of these motorcycle policemen,
and they took off down toward the underpass down there, and so I thought, you
know, that one of them motorcycles backfired, but it wasn't just a few seconds
that, you know, I heard two more of the same type of, you know, sounds, and by
that time people was running everywhere, and falling down and screaming, and
naturally then I knew something was wrong, and so I come to the conclusion
somebody else, somebody was shooting at somebody and I figured it was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You figured it was who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I figured it was somebody shooting at President Kennedy because
people were running and hollering so I just stood still. I have always been
taught when something like that happened or anywhere as far as that it is
always best to stand still because if you run that makes you look guilty sure
enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, then, did you have any impression at that time as to the
direction from which the sound came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, to be frank with you I thought it come from down there,
you know, where that underpass is. There is a series, quite a few number, of
them railroad tracks running together and from where I was standing it sounded
like it was coming from down the railroad tracks there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you able to see the President, could you still see the President's
car when you heard the first sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I couldn't. From there, you know, people were standing
out there on the curb, you see, and you know it drops, you know the ground
drops, off there as you go down toward that underpass and I couldn't see any
of it because people were standing up there in my way, but however, when he
did turn that corner there, there wasn't anybody standing there in the street
and you could see good there, but after you got on past down there you couldn't
see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't see the President's car at the time you heard the sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you stood right there, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. Stood right where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Mr. Shelley was still standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And also Billy Lovelady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The three of you didn't go any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe Billy and them walked down toward that direction
but I didn't. I just stood where I was. I hadn't moved at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody after that come into the Building while you
were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You mean somebody other that didn't work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I stood there a few minutes, you know, and some people
who worked there; you know normally started to go back into the Building
because a lot of us didn't eat our lunch, and so we started back into the Building
and it wasn't but just a few minutes that there were a lot of police officers and
so forth all over the Building there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went back into the Building, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And before you went back into the Building no police officer came
up the steps and into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Not that I know. They could walk by the way and I was standing
there talking to somebody else and didn't see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody say anything about what had happened, did you hear
anybody say anything about the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; right before I went back, some girl who had walked
down a little bit further where I was standing on the steps, and somebody
come back and said somebody had shot President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who it was who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who the girl was who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. She didn't tell me right directly but she just came back and more
or less in a low kind of hollering she just told several people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went back into the Building, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And police officers came in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I would say by the time, you know some of us went
back in, and it wasn't just a few minutes, I say there were several.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, stayed on the first floor there for a few minutes and I
hadn't eaten my lunch so I had my lunch down there in the basement and I
went down there to get my lunch and eat it and I walked back up on the first
floor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you came back into the Building, you came in the front door,
didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down to the basement immediately or did you stand
around on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I stood around for several minutes there, you know, and
then, you know, eventually the ones who hadn't eaten their lunch, some of them
had taken their lunch outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did other people go downstairs with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went down alone, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go at any time in the back end of the Building back near
the door to the loading dock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Perhaps I had better ask you to point out on the map here where
you were. Come over here, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. O.K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You came in back into the Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us where you went and what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, you know like I said I come back through here [indicating
on Commission Exhibit No. 362, diagram of first floor].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By "coming back through here," you mean you came down the
hallway and into the entrance into the first floor warehouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, and you come by Mr. Shelley's office, that is his counter
right here, after you get in, you get off here, that is his office, anyway, right out, I
come out around here, you know where several of the people walked around here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is in the bin area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; the bins don't start automatically right up in here.
I say, there is a little bit more or less, like more or less a hall through here, but
anyway, you know, I say, you have two or three bins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Through here you mean there is sort of a hall after you enter into
the warehouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. From it, after you come past this counter you have several
rows of bins coming this way, but, I say, right after you get past, say, this
last bin right here running that way, right out this general area right here you
have a telephone and everything out in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you indicated that everything that would be beyond this
line, the bin lines, would be clear on the first floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, beyond here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever go into that area where it was clear before you went
downstairs?</p>

<p>From the time you came back into the room, did you go down into this area
which was clear before you went downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't go in here. I was right over right close to
Mr. Shelley's office right around here and sit around and talked with some
guys around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are indicating around Mr. Shelley's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; pretty close right there, like I say more or less right
out over in here we have <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a mark there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Let's <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a circle to show the general area where you and the rest of
them stood around and talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right in there is right around near the telephone and we were
just right around in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We left, you know, after we stood and talked with some guys
there, some of them had eaten and some of them didn't, some of them had sandwiches
in their hands, so naturally I felt like eating and I walked around the
bin and walked down the steps there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Got your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Come back up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't come back up. I was sitting eating my lunch.
I looked at my watch and didn't have but 10 minutes, so I naturally ate faster
than normal, so I was eating a couple of sandwiches, and eat an apple or
something and come right back up and the guys, the people who worked there,
standing around on the first floor, some of them eating their lunches and others
merely talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never went back to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; we didn't. I didn't work any more that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stayed there on the job until you were told to go home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did they tell you to go home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was between 1 and 2 there sometime, roughly, I don't know
what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had the police officers come in there and talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; they come in and talked to all of us. They asked us
to show our proper identification, and then they had us to write our name down
and who to get in touch with if they wanted to see us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ask you where you had been at the time the President
passed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; they had. I told them I was out on the steps there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Asked you who you were with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I told them and naturally Mr. Shelley and Billy
vouched for me and so they didn't think anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anybody around there asking for Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At any time before you went home, did you hear anybody ask for
Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe they did, because they, you know, like
one man showed us, we had to give proper identification and after we passed
him he told us to walk on then to the next man, and we, you know, put down
proper information where he could be found if they wanted to see you and talk
to you any more, and then we went on up to a little bit more to the front
entrance more toward Mr. Shelley's office there with another man and stood
there for a little while and told us all that was there could go ahead and
go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went on home?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did all this occur after you had finished your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did it ever occur to you at any time following the
shooting there was something connecting the shooting with Lee Oswald and
the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say not particularly not at that time, I didn't think anything
about it because, to be frank with you, some were over here, one or two
would be over here talking and just strung out here, on the first floor and I didn't
think anything about it. I see some of the guys, they go out for lunch and
they come back 12:45 so I didn't know whether he had went out to lunch or
not. Some of them do every week.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did any of the policemen interfere with your efforts to
go into the Building and eventually down into the basement where you had
your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you left, did you look for Oswald to see about taking him
home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; I didn't, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there some reason why you didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did. Because like I told you, he was going home to
get the curtain rods and I asked him at the time, the same time, it would be
about that, would he be going home with me Friday afternoon like he had been
doing, he said no. So naturally when they let us go I took on off because I
thought maybe they had already dismissed him and he went on home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you talked to him on Thursday and he told you he wouldn't
be going home on Friday, did he tell you what he was going to do, why he wasn't
going to go home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to him again on Friday morning as to whether or
not he had changed his mind? Did you ask him whether or not you could pick
him up at the end of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To be frank with you, Mr. Ball, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whether you did or not.</p>

<p>Did anybody tell you that Lee Oswald was missing before you went home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; they didn't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you describe for the Commission where you went on
the sixth floor that morning in relationship to the overall picture of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I could.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would you do so, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Do you have a piece of paper I can draw? [Witness draws diagram on piece
of paper.]</p>

<p>Let's see, right here is your two elevator shafts we have. That morning I
used this one over here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would you mark Houston, Elm and the other streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This is Houston, this is Elm right out here. Anyway, like I
said, I won't draw these buildings. I have these two elevator shafts here.
Quickly you come off these elevator shafts right here, we have skids with books
on them, and you see right on those skids you would have some shelves right
about like this and so I merely walked over to the elevator with the two-wheeler
we use on the dock and walked somewhere say maybe halfway, not quite
halfway, there and put up some books, put them down on the floor there, on the
floor level and so I just turned around and come back to the elevator and come
on down, and went about my business. He had me putting up some books there
on the shelves.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From this point here could you see the windows or the
area at the corner of Houston and Elm in the Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; you could. I say you could look down and see this area
back over here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you look over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Right on down there, I knew where the books went so normally I didn't have
to look around. I say, I was going to get through, if you are not familiar with
the books and so forth it would take you a little longer to find and put them up.
But if you know where they go you can put them up very quickly.</p>

<p>So I knew this book went in the shelf because this book we don't handle
very many of them and that is where I put books you don't handle very many,
put them in the shelf.</p>

<p>So I put the books in the shelf and turned around and put them in the elevator
and come on down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can I have this marked as Commission Exhibit 368, the diagram
just drawn by the witness to illustrate his work on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be marked.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 368, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here Commission's 163, a gray blue jacket. Do you recognize
this jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see Lee Oswald wear this jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 162, which can be described for the record
as a gray jacket with zipper, have you seen Lee Oswald wear this jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here Commission 150, which is described as sort of a
rust brown shirt. Have you ever seen Lee Oswald wear this shirt? It has a
hole in the sleeve near the elbow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I have because most time I noticed
when Lee had it, I say he put off his shirt and just wear a T-shirt the biggest
part of the time so really what shirt he wore that day I really didn't see it or
didn't pay enough attention to it whether he did have a shirt on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On that day you did notice one article of clothing, that is, he had a
jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color was the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was a gray, more or less flannel, wool-looking type of jacket
that I had seen him wear and that is the type of jacket he had on that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it have a zipper on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it was one of the zipper types.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It isn't one of these two zipper jackets we have shown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what kind of trousers he had on, what color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Not that day, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You wouldn't remember that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I had seen him wear some gray ones before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Commission's Exhibit No. 157 which are gray trousers.
Had you ever seen him wear these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; to be frank with you, I had seen something more or less
of that order, that type of material, but so far as that, being sure that, was his
pants or some of his clothes, I couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Commission No. 156 which is a pair of gray trousers. Did
you ever see him wear trousers of that type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are not able to tell us then anything or are you able to tell us,
describe any of the clothing he had on that day, except this gray jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the only thing you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here a paper sack which is Commission's Exhibit 364.</p>

<p>That gray jacket you mentioned, did it have any design in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it light or dark gray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was light gray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mentioned it was woolen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Long sleeves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Buttoned sleeves at the wrist, or do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To be frank with you, I didn't notice that much about the jacket,
but I had seen him wear that gray woolen jacket before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say it had a zipper on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now we have over here this exhibit for identification which is
364 which is a paper sack made out of tape, sort of a home made affair. Will
you take a look at this. Does this appear to be anything like the color of the
sack you saw on the back seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I would say it was, it was more a color like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was more like this color, correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it have tape on it or did you notice it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, like I say, I didn't notice that much about it as I didn't
see it very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you take a look at it as to the length. Does it appear to be
about the same length?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will just use this. Was one end of the sack turned over, folded
over? Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, you know, like I was saying, when I glanced at it, but I
say from what I saw I didn't see very much of it, I say the bag wasn't open or
anything like it where you can see the contents. If you was going to say putting&mdash;to
more or less a person putting in carefully he would throw it in carefully,
you put it more toward the back. If he had anything folded up in it I didn't
see that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you saw him get out of the car, when you first saw him when
he was out of the car before he started to walk, you noticed he had the package
under the arm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One end of it was under the armpit and the other he had to hold
it in his right hand. Did the package extend beyond the right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. Like I say if you put it under your armpits and put it
down normal to the side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But the right hand on, was it on the end or the side of the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; he had it cupped in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Cupped in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Take a look at this paper bag which is Commission Exhibit
364 for identification, with reference to the width.</p>

<p>Was the bag about that width or a different width?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well. I would say it appears to me it would be pretty close but
it might be just a little bit too wide. I think it is, because you know yourself
you would have to have a big hand with that size but like I say he had this
cupped in his hand because I remember glancing at him when he was a walking
up ahead of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is another bag here which has been marked Commission's
Exhibit 142. But I don't see the stamp on it. This is FBI No. 10. This was
shown to you before, wasn't it, in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were asked if you had seen this before, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you first saw it, you felt that the bag you saw was of a different
color, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right, and I say they told me this one had been treated in the
lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you will note there is a part of this bag which has not been
treated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So I will show you this part of this exhibit that hasn't been
treated, and tell me whether or not the paper, the color of the paper that
has not been treated, is or is not similar to the color of the paper on the
bag you saw on the back seat of your car that morning.</p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To be frank with you, more like I say the color, the color
I saw would be more like it but I imagine if this hadn't been run through
that process that this color here that you unwrapped would be more closer
to this. This seems to have a little bit different color to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I didn't get the answer because of the&mdash;let's refer to this bag, that
is the colored bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Okay, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the bag that is not colored, and the other is just a bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Okay, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We are talking about the colored bag, the one that has changed
its color. There is a part of the colored bag that hasn't changed color,
isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the part I want to call your attention to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The color of this bag, the colored bag, has not been treated.
Take a look at it. Is that similar to the color of the bag you saw in the
back seat of your car that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would be, surely it could have been, and it couldn't have
been. Like I say, see, you know this color, either one of these colors, is
very similar to the type of paper that you can get out of a store or anything
like that, and so I say it could have been and then it couldn't have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you mean by that that it is similar to the color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you have a definite memory of the color of the bag you
saw on the back seat of your car so that you can distinguish between one
color and another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe it would be more on this basis here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say it would be more on the color of bag No. 364, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You will notice that this bag which is the colored bag, FBI
Exhibit No. 10, is folded over. Was it folded over when you saw it the first
time, folded over to the end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I will say I am not sure about that, whether it was folded
over or not, because, like I say, I didn't pay that much attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Commission Exhibit No. 142.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is the dark bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The dark bag is Commission Exhibit No. 142.</p>

<p>When you were shown this bag, do you recall whether or not you told the
officers who showed you the bag&mdash;did you tell them whether you thought
it was or was not about the same length as the bag you saw on the back
seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I told them that as far as the length there, I told them that
was entirely too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the width?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, like I say now, now I couldn't see much of the
bag from him walking in front of me. Now he could have had some of it
sticking out in front of his hands because I didn't see it from the front. The
only time I did see it was from the back, just a little strip running down from
your arm and so therefore, like that, I say, I know that the bag wouldn't
be that long.</p>

<p>So far as being that wide like I say I couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It could have been that wide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you said that some of the bag might have been beyond
his hands, did you say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I said it could have, now I am not saying it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, it could have been longer than his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It has been suggested that you take this bag, which is the
colored bag, Commission Exhibit No. 142, and put it under your arm just
as a sample, or just to show about how he carried the bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put it under your armpit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Like that, normally your hand would come down like that
and you would say, you would have an item, like you have seen people carry
items like they would be walking along and your arm would come down
like that, just <span class="locked">like&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But are you sure that his hand was at the end of the package
or at the side of the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Like I said, I remember I didn't look at the package very
much, paying much attention, but when I did look at it he did have his
hands on the package like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you said a moment ago you weren't sure whether the
package was longer or shorter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. And his hands because I couldn't see that about the package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By that, do you mean that you don't know whether the package
extended beyond his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; lengthwise, toward his feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; now I don't mean that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. What I was talking about, I said I didn't know where it
extended. It could have or couldn't have, out this way, widthwise not
lengthwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you say it could have been wider than your
original estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you don't think it was longer than his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How tall are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I am 6-foot, a little bit over 6-foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what your arm length is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We can probably measure it before you leave.</p>

<p>Did you ever see Lee taking home anything with him from the Texas Book
Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him taking a package home with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was the last time you can remember you saw Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You mean on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d, that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Somewhere between it was after 10 and somewhere before noon,
because I remember I was walking down to the first floor that day, that was
the only time I went up on the elevator was, like I say, for a few minutes and,
I put that box of books up and put it down, and I was on the first floor putting
up books all day and I seen him back and forth and he would be walking and
getting books and put on the order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the last time you saw him all day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't talk to him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you wear a coat or jacket to work that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was chilly, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you stood out on the front looking at the parade, where was
Shelley standing and where was Lovelady standing with reference to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, see, I was standing, like I say, one step down from the
top, and Mr. Shelley was standing, you know, back from the top step and over
toward the side of the wall there. See, he was standing right over there, and
then Billy was a couple of steps down from me over toward more the wall
also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Usually when Lee walked in the Building in the morning, when
you came to work with him where did he go, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. He just walked in, say, like inside the Building, and
like I say I always went and put my lunch up and hang my jacket or coat up,
whichever I wore, and he was usually around there on the first floor there after
some of them put their lunch in the refrigerator, so far as that I never paid too
much attention to what he usually did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You usually walked in together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you separated after you got in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; after we got into the interior I just went and put my
lunch up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice where Lee kept his lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him come into the Building on other days than
the days that he rode with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You mean did I ever see him come in the Building when he rode
with me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; because when he rode with me we always walked
together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; other than when he rode with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, other than when he rode with me.   No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did he have any particular associates around there that
you knew of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Not that I knew of. I say he didn't mingle with other guys
like the rest of us. The rest of us usually joked back and forth with practically
everybody who worked around there. But he usually kept to himself, that was
the only time he talked to anybody was when he wanted to know something
about a book or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have got a picture taken the day of the parade and it shows
the President's car going by.</p>

<p>Now, take a look at that picture. Can you see your picture any place there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't, because I was back up in this more or less
black area here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Because Billy, like I say, is two or three steps down in front
of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize this fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is Billy, that is Billy Lovelady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Billy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take a marker and make an arrow down that way. That mark
is Billy Lovelady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is where you told us you were standing a moment ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In front of you to the right over to the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this a Commission exhibit?</p>

<p>We will make this a Commission Exhibit No. 369.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 369 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is written in. The arrow marks Billy Lovelady on Commission's
Exhibit No. 369.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you have any lockers there in which you put your clothes,
and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; we don't.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Some boys hang their jackets up in there in that little domino
room where they were going to play dominoes. But here lately, I have been
wondering, you know, most of us wear our jackets, what we have on, because
if you are going out there on a dock in the cold air we usually keep them on.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Thursday afternoon when you went home, drove on home, did
he carry any package with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have a jacket or coat on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a jacket or coat did he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That, you know, like I say gray jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That same gray jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. Now, I can be frank with you, I had seen him wear
that jacket several times, because it is cool type like when you keep a jacket on
all day, if you are working on outside or something like that, you wouldn't go
outside with just a plain shirt on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator, have you any questions you would like to ask?</p>

<p>I think that is all.</p>

<p>Does anybody else have any questions to ask? Do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Frazier, we have here this Exhibit No. 364 which is a sack
and in that we have put a dismantled gun. Don't pay any attention to that.
Will you stand up here and put this under your arm and then take hold of it
at the side?</p>

<p>Now, is that anywhere near similar to the way that Oswald carried the
package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, you know, like I said now, I said I didn't pay much
<span class="locked">attention&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Turn around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I didn't pay much attention, but when I did, I say, he had this
part down here, like the bottom would be short he had cupped in his hand like
that and, say, like walking from the back if you had a big arm jacket there you
wouldn't tell much from a package back there, the physical features. If you
could see it from the front like when you walk and meet somebody you could
tell about the package, but walking from behind you couldn't tell much about
the package whatsoever about the width. But he didn't carry it from the back.
If this package were shorter he would have it cupped in his hands.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Could he have had the top of it behind his shoulder, or are
you sure it was cupped under his shoulder there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; because the way it looked, you know, like I say, he had it
cupped in his hand.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I said from where I noticed he had it cupped in his hands. And
I don't see how you could have it anywhere other than under your armpit
because if you had it cupped in your hand it would stick over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could he have carried it this way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. Never in front here. Like that. Now, that is what I
was talking to you about. No, I say he couldn't because if he had you would
have seen the package sticking up like that.</p>

<p>From what I seen walking behind he had it under his arm and you couldn't
tell that he had a package from the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you cupped the bottom of your package in the hands, will you
stand up, again, please, and the upper part of the package is not under the
armpit, the top of the package extends almost up to the level of your ear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or your eye level, and when you put the package under your armpit,
the upper part of the package, and take a hold of the side of it with your right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
hand, it extends on approximately about 8 inches, about the span of my hand,
more than 8 inches, 8, 10 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. If you were using a yardstick or one of these <span class="locked">little&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I was using my hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I know you were, but there are some different means to measure
it. I will say it varies, if you use a yardstick. You can go and measure something
with a tape measure, with a yardstick and come up with a different measurement
altogether, maybe a quarter of an inch shorter or longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I was asked, there was some uncertainty in your testimony as to
the direction from which you heard the shots fired. Let's see if we can illustrate
it.</p>

<p>You heard the shots fired and you expressed an opinion that it came from a
certain direction. I would like to clear that up, if I could, on this map.</p>

<p>Here is the Texas School Book Depository Building, and you were standing
right here, you said, weren't you? Can you tell me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. You know the entrance there is not quite at that corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That close.</p>

<p>Now, you say you heard these three sounds which you later thought were
probably shots, you thought it came from a certain direction.</p>

<p>Can you tell us from what direction as illustrated on the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. Now I say, you know where it is the straight curve that
goes under the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the parkway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. I say it runs over this parkway, you don't have it on
here&mdash;anyway, I say these railroad tracks there is a series of them that come
up over this, up over this overpass there, and from where I was standing, I say,
it is my true opinion, that is what I thought, it sounded like it came from over
there, in the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be east and south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; that would be west and south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. West and south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; it would be north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; it wouldn't be north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it wouldn't be south because that is in that direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is north, and you say it, I believe, it came from north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would be more or less west and north were these tracks from
this overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your direction was west and north as the source of the sound.</p>

<p>Well, take a look at the map that does show the overpass and you will put a
mark on that.</p>

<p>Did any other people who were standing there with you express any opinion as
to where they thought the sounds came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I say, after we found out it was shots I see some of the
other people around there said when they were staying there, said that is what
it was, downward right back from us, like where we were standing. If we had
been standing somewhere else you might have gotten a different opinion, but
from where we were standing on the steps there it sounded like back down to the
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is a Commission Exhibit, No. 347. It is an aerial photograph,
and it shows the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Here is the Depository Building here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right, sir. Here is the parkway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here are the overpasses here.</p>

<p>Can you show us on that map where you think&mdash;will that map&mdash;can you on
that map indicate the general direction from which you thought the sounds came
from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; because we were standing right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Don't mark it up right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right. But what I am trying to say is we were standing down
there, and back over here, this over here is more or less a knoll, and you can
look over there and see this. You see this furthest left line that curved around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
here is the ones we take to come out on Stemmons Expressway, and this is a high
knoll up here which runs where the tracks are, from standing there it sounded
like it came from this general area over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just mark on that if you can, if you can mark a source.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This is where it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark a circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say just like over in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's make it a little heavier. In that general direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. That was just part of the knoll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The circle marked on No. 347, we will identify it with an "F," the
circle marked "F" represents the direction, general direction, of a source of
sound as you&mdash;as occurred to you as you stood on the front steps of the Texas
Book Depository Building, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Anything from you, Senator?</p>

<p>Well, that will be all. Thank you very much for coming and testifying before
the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Thank you, Mr. Warren.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right, bring in the next witness.</p>

<p>The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mrs. Randle, I will just read you a brief statement of the purpose of our meeting
today.</p>

<p>The purpose of today's hearing is to hear the testimony of Buell Wesley Frazier
and Linnie Mae Randle. The Commission has been advised that these two witnesses
have stated that they saw Lee Harvey Oswald on the morning of November 22, 1963.
The Commission proposes to ask these witnesses questions concerning
their knowledge of the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>You have a copy of that, do you not?</p>

<p>Very well, Mr. Ball will conduct the examination.</p>

<p>Will you rise and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Please be seated.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball?</p>

<h2 id="lmr">TESTIMONY OF LINNIE MAE RANDLE</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Randle, where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. 2438 Westfield, Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you live there with your husband and three daughters, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And your brother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wesley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long has Wesley been living there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Since September, somewhere around the first, I am not sure
just the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know Mrs. Ruth Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. She is a neighbor that lives up the street from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you first meet Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, for a period, I am not sure of this, it is quite 2 years,
I lived across the street from her. I didn't visit with her, but I visited with
her neighbor who lives next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Mrs. Dorothy Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is on Fifth Street in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. That is right; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was before you moved down the street to the corner of
Westfield and Fifth Street?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had never visited in Mrs. Paine's home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I was in her home on one occasion that I remember at a birthday
party for one of her children and she invited mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. It has been about a year ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the only time you have visited Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever meet Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you meet her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. The first time I met her was over at this Mrs. Roberts. I had
gone up there to see Mrs. Roberts and her, Mrs. Oswald and Mrs. Paine was
over there drinking coffee, that was the first time I met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, I believe it was the first week in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the first time you had ever met Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Officially met her. I had seen her out in the yard and through
the neighbor I knew who she was. I hadn't met her until that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see her again to talk to her, Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, she couldn't speak English, "How are you" and things
like that was about all she could say and I did visit with Mrs. Roberts quite
often and so she would be out in the yard and she would speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In whose yards, Mrs. Roberts' yard or Mrs. Paine's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Mrs. Paine's. She played with her children, and kept the yard
and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But on this one occasion she was in the house, Mrs. Roberts' house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Mrs. Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With Mrs. Paine, Mrs. Roberts and yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there some conversation at that time about her husband Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, they had&mdash;it was just general knowledge in the neighborhood
that he didn't have a job and she was expecting a baby. Of course, I didn't
know where he was or anything. And of course you know just being neighborly
and everything, we felt sorry for Marina because her baby was due right away
as we understood it, and he didn't have any work, so they said, so it was
<span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Paine told you that Lee didn't have any work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, I suppose. It was just in conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Marina didn't take part in the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No. She couldn't. So far as I know, she couldn't speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Paine talked about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything said then about the Texas School Book Depository
as a place he might get a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, we didn't say that he might get a job, because I didn't
know there was a job open. The reason that we were being helpful, Wesley had
just looked for a job, and I had helped him to try to find one. We listed several
places that he might go to look for work. When you live in a place you know
some places that someone with, you know, not very much of an education can
find work.</p>

<p>So, it was among one of the places that we mentioned. We mentioned
several others, and Mrs. Paine said that well, he couldn't apply for any of the
jobs that would require driving because he couldn't drive, and it was just in
conversation that you might talk just any day and not think a thing on earth
about it. In fact, I didn't even know that he had even tried any place that we
mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were some of the other places mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, I remember two of them. Mrs. Roberts entered into the
conversation and, of course, she is more familiar with the place than I am. It
was Manor Bakeries which was a home delivery service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Then there was this Texas Gypsum which makes sheet rock and things like
that, and we mentioned because Wesley had tried those places that I mentioned
those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you also mentioned the Texas Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, I didn't know there was a job opening over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But did you mention it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. But we said he might try over there. There might be work
over there because it was the busy season but I didn't have any previous
knowledge that there was any job opening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you later learn that Lee had applied for a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. She told me, Mrs. Paine told me, later that he had applied
for the job, and had gotten the job and she thanked us for naming the
places and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell your brother that a fellow named Lee Oswald was
going to work for them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir; I didn't even know his name. She said Lee so I
just assumed that was his last name and I just merely mentioned to Wesley
that he had got the job or a job over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That Lee had the job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. That Mrs. Paine said that, I had told Wesley that he might&mdash;that
she said he was going to call over there.</p>

<p>In fact, Mrs. Paine asked me if I would call and see if there was a job
available and I told her, no, that I didn't know anybody over there, and
if she wanted to call over the place she would have to do it because I
didn't know if there was any job openings over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told Wesley, though, that you had&mdash;Mrs. Paine had told you
that Lee had applied for a job and gotten a job there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Sir, I don't remember if I mentioned it to him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you said a moment ago that you had mentioned something
to Wesley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I might have had. But I can't say for sure I did because
at the time it was unimportant to me. It didn't really matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you are not sure whether you did or didn't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. That is right. I might have, I don't know maybe for sure
if I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Lee tell you at sometime that he had started to drive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I never talked to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Wesley tell you that he was driving Lee home weekends or
driving him to Irving weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Wesley had told me that he asked to ride out on weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him arrive with Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recall on a Thursday night, November 21 that you saw
Lee get out of Wesley's car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of night was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. About 5:20, I believe, 5:15 or 5:25 something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I was on my way to the grocery store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to Wesley about the fact that he had brought Lee
home on this night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you think it was unusual that he had come home that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, I knew that he had&mdash;Friday is the only time he had ever
ridden with him before which was a couple of times, I don't think he rode with
him over three times, I am not sure but I never did know of him arriving, you
know, except on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did you mention to Wesley that night or did you ask Wesley
that night how Lee happened to come home on Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I might have asked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anything about curtain rods?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you remember about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. He had told <span class="locked">Wesley&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what Wesley told you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. What Wesley told me. That Lee had rode home with him to
get some curtain rods from Mrs. Paine to fix up his apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did Wesley tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, that afternoon I suppose I would have had to ask him,
he wouldn't have just told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After he came home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I was on my way to the store. So I probably asked him
when I got back what he was doing riding home with him on Thursday
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think that was the time that Wesley told <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir; after I got back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That Lee had come home to get some curtain rods?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, I am sure he told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The next morning did you get breakfast for Wesley, you, and
your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes; mother and my children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were packing his lunch, too, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I saw him as he crossed the street and come across my driveway
to where Wesley had his car parked by the carport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What street did he cross to go over?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. He crossed Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you saw him walking along, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he carrying any package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he carrying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. He was carrying a package in a sort of a heavy brown bag,
heavier than a grocery bag it looked to me. It was about, if I might measure,
about this long, I suppose, and he carried it in his right hand, had the top sort
of folded down and had a grip like this, and the bottom, he carried it this way,
you know, and it almost touched the ground as he carried it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me see. He carried it in his right hand, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where was his hand gripping the middle of the package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir; the top with just a little bit sticking up. You know
just like you grab something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he was grabbing it with his right hand at the top of the package
and the package almost touched the ground?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He walked over to your house, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, I saw him as he started crossing the street. Where he
come from then I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know where he went from that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Where he went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him go to the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. He opened the right back door and I just saw that he was laying
the package down so I closed the door. I didn't recognize him as he walked
across my carport and I at that moment I wondered who was fixing to come to
my back door so I opened the door slightly and saw that it&mdash;I assumed he was
getting in the car but he didn't, so he come back and stood on the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He put the package in the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir; I don't know if he put it on the seat or on the floor
but I just know he put it in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have got a package here which is marked Commission Exhibit
No. 364. You have seen this before, I guess, haven't you, I think the FBI
showed it to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the color of that package in any way similar to the color of
this package which is 364?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Similar kind of paper, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was the length of it any similar, anywhere near similar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well, it wasn't that long, I mean it was folded down at the top
as I told you. It definitely wasn't that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How about the width?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. The width is about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The width is about right.</p>

<p>Can you stand up here and show us how he was carrying it. Using this
package as an example only?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. What he had in there, it looked too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This looks too long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About how long would you think the package would be, just measure
it right on there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I would say about like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean from here to here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir; with that folded down with this much for him to grip
in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This package is about the span of my hand, say 8 inches, is that
right? He would have about this much to grip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. What I remember seeing is about this long, sir, as I told you it
was folded down so it could have been this long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. You figure about 2 feet long, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. A little bit more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A little more than 2 feet.</p>

<p>There is another package here. You remember this was shown you. It is a
discolored bag, which is Exhibit No. 142, and remember you were asked by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation agents if this looked like the package; do you
remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, first of all with color, you told them the bag was not the color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But they showed you a part of the bag that had not been discolored,
didn't they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Looking at this part of the bag which has not been discolored does
that appear similar to the color of the bag you saw Lee carrying that morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes; it is a heavy type of wrapping paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, with reference to the width of this bag, does that look about
the width of the bag that he was carrying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I would say so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about length?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. You mean the entire bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. There again you have the problem of all this down here. It
was folded down, of course, if you would take it from the <span class="locked">bottom&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fold it to about the size that you think it might be.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. This is the bottom here, right. This is the bottom, this part down
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I believe so, but I am not sure. But let's say it is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. And this goes this way, right?   Do you want me to hold it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. About this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that about right? That is 28½ inches.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I measured 27 last time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You measured 27 once before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How was Lee dressed that morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. He had on a white T-shirt, I just saw him from the waist up,
I didn't pay any attention to his pants or anything, when he was going with
the package. I was more interested in that. But he had on a white T-shirt and
I remember some sort of brown or tan shirt and he had a gray jacket, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A gray jacket. I will show you some clothing here. First, I will
show you a gray jacket. Does this look anything like the jacket he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Similar to that. I didn't pay an awful lot of attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it similar in color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir; I think so. It had big sleeves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Take a look at these sleeves. Was it similar in color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the Commission Exhibit on this jacket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. It was gray, I am not sure of the shade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 163.</p>

<p>I will show you another shirt which is Commission No. 150.</p>

<p>Does this look anything like the shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Well now, I don't remember it being that shade of brown. It
could have been but I was looking through the screen and out the window but
I don't remember it being exactly that. I thought it was a solid color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is another jacket which is a gray jacket, does this look anything
like the jacket he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir; I remember its being gray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, this one is gray but of these two the jacket I last showed
you is Commission Exhibit No. 162, and this blue gray is 163, now if you had
to choose between these two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. I would choose the dark one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You would choose the dark one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which is 163, as being more similar to the jacket he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir; that I remember. But I, you know, didn't pay an
awful lot of attention to his jacket. I remember his T-shirt and the shirt more
so than I do the jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The witness just stated that 163 which is the gray-blue is similar
to the jacket he had on. 162, the light gray jacket was not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>.. Senator, have you any questions?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. No questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Have you any questions, Mr. Powell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think I do have one.</p>

<p>Prior to the assassination of President Kennedy, did any FBI agents or police
officer ever visit your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And said anything to you about Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could I ask, Mr. Chief Justice, along the line Senator Cooper
touched on&mdash;whether there had been any conversation in the neighborhood
prior to the assassination of any FBI agents or police officers having visited
in the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard nothing along rumors of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No. Later, after all this was over, I had heard that they had
been to Mrs. Paine's residence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there was no excitement in the neighborhood up to that
point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have one question, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>You used an expression there, that the bag appeared heavy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You meant that there was some weight appeared to <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. To the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To the bottom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes. It tapered like this as he hugged it in his hand. It was
more bulky toward the bottom than it was this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Toward the top? More bulky toward the bottom than toward the
top?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. On that point&mdash;did you see Lee Oswald place the package in
the automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. In the automobile. I do not know if he put it on the seat or
on the floor.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I mean did you see him throw open the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When he placed the package in there do you remember
whether he used one hand or two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. No; because I only opened the door briefly and what made me
establish the door on Wesley's car, it is an old car and that door, the window
is broken and everything and it is hard to close, so that cinched in my mind
which door it was, too. But it was only briefly that I looked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, could I ask&mdash;how far away were you? You
were at the kitchen door and the automobile was in the driveway, what was the
distance between yourself and Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Sir, I don't know. The carport will take care of two cars, and
then Wesley's car was on the other side of the carport so that would be three
car lengths plus inbetween space.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Car widths?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Car widths, excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a light day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. It was sort of cloudy, but there wasn't any&mdash;I mean it wasn't
dark or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough as you can recall&mdash;can you recall
what the fabric of the jacket was that Mr. Oswald had on this morning, was it
twill or wool or gabardine? Cotton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Probably cotton or gabardine, something like that that would
repel water probably, and that is just my own opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your present recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Randle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Randle, thank you very much for coming, you may be
excused.</p>

<h2 id="cc">TESTIMONY OF CORTLANDT CUNNINGHAM</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Cortlandt Cunningham.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Cunningham, will you raise your right hand and be
sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony given before this Commission will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Cunningham, be seated there.</p>

<p>What is your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am a special agent of the FBI.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your specialty with the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am assigned to the FBI laboratory in the Firearms
Identification Unit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a rifle here that has been identified as Commission Exhibit
No. 139, it has been in your custody, hasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought it over here this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And I requested you disassemble it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take it out of the sack and put it before the Commission.</p>

<p>Do you need any special tools to assemble this rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I notice you have a screwdriver there. Can you assemble it without
the use of a screwdriver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What can you use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Any object that would fit the slots on the five screws
that retain the stock to the action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you do it with a 10-cent piece?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you do that&mdash;about how long will it take you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I know I can do it, but I have never been timed as far as
using a dime. I have been timed using a screwdriver, which required a little
over 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 2 minutes with a screwdriver.</p>

<p>Try it with the dime and let's see how long it takes.</p>

<p>Okay. Start now. Six minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I think I can improve on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the only tool you used was a 10-cent piece?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Does the bolt work all right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Once in a while with regard to the top portion&mdash;namely
the retaining screw and the top stock&mdash;you have trouble getting them engaged
on this particular model.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is the case on this weapon. On that one over there,
however, it slid right on when I put it together a little while ago; it was much
faster.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. This is a weapon identical to the one that has been
identified as the assassination weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. This is the assassination weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is the weapon found on the sixth floor of the Texas Book
Depository.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. May I ask, have you fired it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Many times.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That has been fired many times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can disassemble it in a lesser amount of time, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Definitely, it comes apart much faster. I can do it for you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I understand with a screwdriver you put the rifle together
in 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; a few seconds over 2 minutes, somewhere around
2¼, 2½ minutes, readily.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. And I am sure I can assemble it faster the second time
with a dime than I did the last time but I did have trouble with that one
retaining screw.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Is there anything more you have on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Anybody?</p>

<p>Well, Agent Cunningham, thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't own your own cab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; they don't allow that in that city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you worked for that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. 37 years. Not for that company, sir, but for the original owners,
it started out. I have been in with that original company but all banded
together in one cab company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you on duty on the 22nd of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were your hours that day at work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, my hours run from 6 to 4, sir; 6 in the morning to 4
in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a cab were you driving on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. A 1961 Checker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it equipped with radio equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You can call in to your dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By a two-way radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you operate on cab stands or do you cruise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; you just go out in the morning and wherever they
send you you go to work and wherever you unload you check in they give you
another call like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 12:30 that day where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, about 12:30 as you say, sir; I was at the Greyhound
bus station. I have a copy of my trip sheet here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could I see that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The FBI took the original and the pictures of the cab and
everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is what I have been waiting for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I think it is supposed to be delivered to you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right. I am glad you have that copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I thought maybe you might need it. You look down there it
says Greyhound, 500 North Beckley, I think it is marked 12:30 to 12:45. Now
that could have been 10 minutes off in each direction because I didn't use a
watch, I just guess, in other words, all my trips are marked about 15 minutes
each.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am going to let you use this manifest to refresh your memory,
Mr. Whaley. I have seen it. I am going to ask you some questions and you
refresh your memory if you will from the manifest.</p>

<p>First of all, describe the document you are using, what is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. It is a trip sheet manifest. The company gets the amount of
money you have run, your meter reading and all, and they have to keep it
because of the city ordinance requirement that the taxis make this kind of
manifest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me when you make the entries, you make the entries when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Sometimes I make them right after I make the trips, sir, and
sometimes I make three or four trips before I make the entries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you required by your employer to describe the trip, where you
went, how far it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Not by the employer, sir. All the employers are interested in
are the meter reading and your tolls. The city of Dallas ordinance requires
that you put down where you picked the passenger up, where you unload the
passenger. They are not interested in the price, the number of passengers and
the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the manifest does contain that information, though, does it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you describe the different columns of the manifest, that information
that is in each column generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Over on the left side, where you see call or pickup, if you get
the call on your radio you mark with a "C" and if somebody hails you on the
street that is marked "P" for pickup.</p>

<p>In the next column it has the trip numbers from one to fifty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The number of the trips you make that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir. In the third column it says "from." Like this first
one, 4924 Belmont and then to the next column, to the airport.</p>

<p>The next column is the "meter reading," what the meter said, $1.75. The
next column says "flat rate." If it had been an extra passenger or so and you
had a flat rate you would put it in that column.</p>

<p>The third column is "charge," the people who have the charge accounts
through the company in the car, you put the meter reading in there because you
don't get cash and you put charge, the company takes it off.</p>

<p>The next column says the number of passengers and that first trip was four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
passengers, time out six o'clock, I got that trip out of the barn and it is marked
"call."</p>

<p>6:20 is "time in." "Mileage in" was 44. Now, see I didn't put the mileage
out on the first one, the mileage out is up here, 35 to 44. It would have been
nine miles I made on the first trip.</p>

<p>Over here on the side here, it has the number of trips I made that day which
is 21, on the meter registered 21 trips 45 cents a trip is $9.45. 157 units, a
unit is a dime clicks every four-tenths of a mile. That would be 157 units at
$15.70. Added total of $25.15. I used 5½ gallons of gas, had eight pickups in
13 calls and 29 passengers. That is it complete, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Now, look at your manifest and tell me where you were at 12 o'clock the day
of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. 12 o'clock I got a call to the Travis Hotel. I have got it
marked 16 which is the Continental bus station, stand No. 15, 55 cents. I unloaded
that at 12:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go at 12:15 according to your record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. According to my record I got a pickup at the Continental bus
station which is stand 16 and went to the Greyhound which is 55 cents. I unloaded
at the Greyhound, I have got it marked 12:30. See there is that 15
minutes you say I am off, I just mark it 15, I don't put the correct time on the
sheet because they don't require it, sir, but anywhere approximate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, it took you about 15 minutes to <span class="locked">go&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. It actually took about nine minutes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you put the trip ending Greyhound around 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You remember that trip, do you, you remember the fact that you
took the trip to the Greyhound and parked your car at the Greyhound or your cab
at the Greyhound, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; I remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you standing at the Greyhound, at your cab stand at the
Greyhound, long before you picked up another passenger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir, there was no one at the Greyhound stand and when I
unloaded at the door I just pulled up about 30 feet to the stand and stopped and
then I wanted a package of cigarettes, I was out so I started to get out and I
saw this passenger coming so I waited for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was coming down the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He was walking down the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What street was he walking down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Lamar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would that mean he was walking south on Lamar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He was walking south on Lamar from Commerce when I saw
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be on which side of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The west side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. South on Lamar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice how he was dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir. I didn't pay much attention to it right then. But it
all came back when I really found out who I had. He was dressed in just
ordinary work clothes. It wasn't khaki pants but they were khaki material,
blue faded blue color, like a blue uniform made in khaki. Then he had on a
brown shirt with a little silverlike stripe on it and he had on some kind
of jacket, I didn't notice very close but I think it was a work jacket that
almost matched the pants.</p>

<p>He, his shirt was open three buttons down here. He had on a T-shirt. You
know, the shirt was open three buttons down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what happened after that, will you tell us in your own words
what he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, on this which was the 14th trip when I picked up at
the Greyhound I marked it 12:30 to 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say that can be off 15 minutes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That can be off either direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything up to 15 minutes, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; I wrote that trip up the same time I wrote the one
up from the Continental bus station to the Greyhound, I marked this 12:15
to 12:30 and started 12:30 to 12:45. And the next one starts at 1:15 to 1:30
and it goes on all day long every 15 minutes the time keeps pretty approximate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take the 12:30 trip, tell me about that, what the passenger
said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He said, "May I have the cab?"</p>

<p>I said, "You sure can. Get in." And instead of opening the back door he
opened the front door, which is allowable there, and got in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Got in the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir. The front seat. And about that time an old lady, I
think she was an old lady, I don't remember nothing but her sticking her head
down past him in the door and said, "Driver, will you call me a cab down here?"</p>

<p>She had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and he opened the
door a little bit like he was going to get out and he said, "I will let you have
this one," and she says, "No, the driver can call me one."</p>

<p>So, I didn't call one because I knew before I could call one one would come
around the block and keep it pretty well covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; that is not what I said, but that is the reason I didn't
call one at the time and I asked him where he wanted to go. And he said,
"500 North Beckley."</p>

<p>Well, I started up, I started to that address, and the police cars, the sirens was
going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just a big uproar in that end of
town and I said, "What the hell. I wonder what the hell is the uproar?"</p>

<p>And he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these people that
don't like to talk so I never said any more to him.</p>

<p>But when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and North Beckley which
is the 500 block, he said, "This will do fine," and I pulled over to the curb
right there. He gave me a dollar bill, the trip was 95 cents. He gave me a
dollar bill and didn't say anything, just got out and closed the door and walked
around the front of the cab over to the other side of the street. Of course,
traffic was moving through there and I put it in gear and moved on, that is
the last I saw of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you parked your car you parked on what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I wasn't parked, I was pulled to the curb on Neches and North
Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Neches, corner of Neches and North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Which is the 500 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What direction was your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. South.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The cab was headed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. South.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it would be on the west side of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Parked, stopped on the west side of the intersection, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he got out of the cab did he go around in front of your cab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He went around in front, yes, sir; crossed the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Across to the east side of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see whether he walked south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I didn't see whether he walked north or south from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, he walked east from your cab and that is the
last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything in particular about him beside his clothing
that you could identify such as jewelry, bracelets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; he had on a bracelet of some type on his left arm.
It looked like an identification bracelet. Just shiny, you know, how you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
anything shiny, an unusual watchband or something shiny, you notice things
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a map of Dallas here, which I would like to have marked
as the Commission's next exhibit which is Exhibit No. 371.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be so marked.</p>

<p>(The map referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 371 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to offer into evidence Exhibits Nos. 368 and 369 that
were marked yesterday.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibits Nos. 368 and 369, heretofore marked for identification,
were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And 371 being a form map of Dallas can probably be offered in
evidence at this time. It is going to be used to illustrate the witness' testimony.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That may be done.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 371, heretofore marked for identification was
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a map here which is described as Dallas street map, Republic
National Bank of Dallas, and in one corner of this map there is shown a
small map of downtown Dallas.</p>

<p>Will you point on the map there to the Greyhound bus station?</p>

<p>Let's take the small map. It was on the corner of Jackson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. And Lamar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Lamar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The northwest corner, Greyhound bus station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have seen this map before, have you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; I am very familiar with that map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And let's take Lamar, here is Jackson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Lamar is down here, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Jackson, this is the Houston viaduct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Jackson, and Lamar is right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, the Greyhound bus station is on the northwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Suppose we make an "X" there at Jackson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Lamar. That is where you picked your passenger up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you started out which direction did you go, and before you
mark just take this blunt end and then we will mark it after you describe it on
the map.</p>

<p>Now, the next street is Austin, just to the west of Lamar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I turned to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I turned to the left off Lamar onto Jackson, went one block
to Austin, then from Austin I turned to the left again and went one block over
to Wood Street.</p>

<p>Now, the reason for that is if you catch this light right at Lamar and Jackson,
this other light turns green as you make your turn here and the other one
turns green as you make your turn at Wood. You just move through traffic.
That was my reason for making the turn.</p>

<p>Then I turned left on Wood off Austin and went straight on down Wood to
Houston which is the street which we call the old viaduct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You call that the Houston Street viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Went across the viaduct to Zangs, as soon as you get across
the angle to the left, that is Zangs Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Take the black pen and draw your course along this small map
as far as you can go and we will go to the continuation of the map.</p>

<p>Now, can you tell us&mdash;did everybody see this course&mdash;now can you tell us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
where you were when the sirens were blowing and you saw police cars all
around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I was still at the Greyhound, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. They were there when I loaded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in the course of your travel down to the Houston viaduct did
you see any police cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Oh, yes, sir; lots of them, what we call triangle, three-wheeled
motorcycle, they all seemed to be converging on one spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, it seemed to be the courthouse, that is what it seemed
to me at that time. I didn't know what had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The courthouse is about a block from the Texas State Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. You could throw a baseball from one building to the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now we will turn to the large map and we will still use the&mdash;get
downtown. Here we are. Will you use&mdash;Lamar and Jackson again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. This will be kind of ticklish because that is very small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Main, Commerce, Jackson, Lamar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. To Austin, to Wood, to Houston, to the viaduct, across the
viaduct, let's see, Colorado comes in off this, this is the Zangs Boulevard, the
red line where it hits Marcel is here, that is Zangs Boulevard. Up past Colorado,
still going Zangs here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are going along Zangs, will you go <span class="locked">along&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I am trying to find Beckley, the green light changed from red
to green on Beckley, right here is an intersection; Zangs Boulevard goes on up,
and Beckley turns off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Neches right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Let me see where Neches is, is that right? Yes, that is it.
This is the intersection right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We put an "X" there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is where he got off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is where you dropped your passenger, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is&mdash;as far as I can see that is Neches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is Neches, that is Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; that is right, because that is the 500 block of North
Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, we will mark the beginning of your trip on the large map as
"Y", and where you dropped your passenger as an "X".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "Y" is the corner of Lamar and Jackson, and "X" is the corner
of Neches and Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. O.K.</p>

<p>Can you tell me what distance that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, it was 95 cents on the meter, the meter starts off at 45
cents, then it goes four-tenths of a mile and it clicks a dime which would be
55, then a dime every four-tenths of a mile after that and it was almost ready
to click a $1.05 when it stopped, so I imagine that would be 55 cents, would
be eight-tenths of a mile and then after the first 45 cents it runs 25 cents a
mile, because it gets a dime every four-tenths.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So you had 95 cents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. 65 cents would be three, four-tenths, would be 1 mile and two-tenths.
75 would be one mile and six-tenths. 85 would be one&mdash;would be 2
miles. 95 would be 2 and four-tenths, almost ready to click.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you give them for 45 cents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Four-tenths of a mile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Four-tenths of a mile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. It goes four-tenths of a mile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Five clicks after the first?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. 45 cents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, then, you ran <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. About 2½ miles, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Two and one-half miles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Two miles and four-tenths approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you give me any estimate of the time it took you to go that
2½ miles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Not actually, sir. I run it again with the policeman because
the policeman was worried, he run the same trip and he couldn't come out the
same time I did. But he was turning off of Jackson and Lamar when the light
was wrong, and he was hitting a red light at Wood&mdash;I mean at Austin and
Jackson and he hit a red light at Wood and Austin, then he hit a red light
at Houston. Where I wait to make my turn until the light is right just after
it has been green, almost ready for it to come red, turn right then, then the
other lights turn green just as fast as you get to them, go on right through,
you save about 2 minutes in traffic that way. That is where I got the 2 minutes
on him he never could make up. So I had to go back with him to make that
trip to to show him I was right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How much time, in that experiment, when you hit the lights right,
how long did it take you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Nine minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Nine minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Nine minutes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now on this particular trip with Oswald, do you recall
the lights being with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. They were with me, sir; for I timed them that way before I
took off. Because I made that so much that I know the light system and how
they are going to turn.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So this was a typical trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The witness has been driving a taxicab in Dallas for 36
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Thirty-seven, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. You name an intersection in the city of Dallas and I will tell
you what is on all four corners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stop and let your passenger out on this run on the north
or south side of the intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. On the north side, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. North side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Northwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Northwest corner of Neches and Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Northwest corner of Neches and Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have some clothing here. Commission Exhibit No. 150, does
that look like the shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is the shirt, sir, it has my initials on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, this is the shirt the man had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; that is the same one the FBI man had me identify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is the shirt the man had on who took your car at Lamar
and Jackson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. As near as I can recollect as I told him. I said that is the
shirt he had on because it had a kind of little stripe in it, light-colored stripe.
I noticed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here are two pair of pants, Commission Exhibit No. 157 and
Commission Exhibit No. 156. Does it look anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I don't think I can identify the pants except they were the
same color as that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which color?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. More like this lighter color, at least they were cleaner or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is 157?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you are not sure about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I am not sure about the pants. I wouldn't be sure of the shirt
if it hadn't had that light stripe in it. I just noticed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Commission No. 162 which is a gray jacket with zipper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I think that is the jacket he had on when he rode with me in
the cab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Look something like it?</p>

<p>And here is Commission Exhibit No. 163, does this look like anything he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He had this one on or the other one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is what I told you I noticed. I told you about the shirt
being open, he had on the two jackets with the open shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait a minute, we have got the shirt which you have identified
as the rust brown shirt with the gold stripe in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said that a <span class="locked">jacket&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That jacket now it might have been clean, but the jacket he
had on looked more the color, you know like a uniform set, but he had this coat
here on over that other jacket, I am sure, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is the blue-gray jacket, heavy blue-gray jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later that day did you&mdash;were you called down to the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; they came and got me, sir, the next day after I told my
superior when I saw in the paper his picture, I told my superiors that that had
been my passenger that day at noon. They called up the police and they came
up and got me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you saw in the newspaper the picture of the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to your superior and told him you thought he was your
passenger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the Dallas police come out to see you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The Dallas police came down and took me down and the FBI
was waiting there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before they brought you down did they show you a picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They brought you down to the Dallas police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, I tried to get by the reporters, stepping over television
cables and you couldn't hardly get by, they would grab you and wanted to know
what you were doing down here, even with the detectives one in front and one
behind you. Then they took me in an office there and I think Bill Alexander,
the Assistant District Attorney, two or three, I was introduced to two or three
who were FBI men and they wanted my deposition of what happened.</p>

<p>So, I told them to the best of my ability. Then they took me down in their
room where they have their show-ups, and all, and me and this other taxi driver
who was with me, sir, we sat in the room awhile and directly they brought in
six men, young teenagers, and they all were handcuffed together. Well, they
wanted me to pick out my passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
At that time he had on a pair of black pants and white T-shirt, that is all
he had on. But you could have picked him out without identifying him by just
listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman, telling them it wasn't
right to put him in line with these teen-agers and all of that and they asked me
which one and I told them. It was him all right, the same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They had him in line with men much younger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. With five others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Men much younger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Not much younger, but just young kids they might have got
them in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he look older than those other boys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he was talking, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what he
thought about them. They knew what they were doing and they were trying
to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did that aid you in the identification of the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; it wouldn't have at all, except that I said anybody who
wasn't sure could have picked out the right one just for that. It didn't aid me
because I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't think that that in any way influenced your identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; it did not. When you drive a taxi, sir, as long as I
have, you can almost look at a man, in fact, you have to, to be able to tell whether
you can trust or whether you can't trust him, what he is.</p>

<p>Now, like you got in my taxicab and I looked you over and you told me just
wait for me here and went in the building, well, I will have to know whether
I could just say, "OK, sir." Or say, "Will you leave me a $5 bill, sir?"</p>

<p>When you drive a taxi that long you learn to judge people and what I actually
thought of the man when he got in was that he was a wino who had been off his
bottle for about two days, that is the way he looked, sir, that was my opinion
of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was there about his appearance that gave you that impression?
Hair mussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Just the slow way he walked up. He didn't talk. He wasn't
in any hurry. He wasn't nervous or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he look dirty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He looked like his clothes had been slept in, sir, but he wasn't
actually dirty. The T-shirt was a little soiled around the collar but the bottom
part of it was white. You have to know those winos, or they will get in and
ride with you and there isn't nothing you can do but call the police, the city gets
the fine and you get nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was the other cab driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I don't know his name, sir. He worked for the same company
but he works out of the Oak Cliff branch. They say he was the one who saw
him kill the policeman, the one who used the policeman's microphone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that Mr. Scoggins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Scoggins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. It could have been, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I just know he drives taxi 213. He works out of Oak Cliff
branch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have a copy of the manifest temporarily marked
370.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. You may have it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Commission 370, and offer it into evidence and ask leave to submit
the original, if it is brought in, when it is brought here by the FBI.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, it may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The manifest referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 370 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be 370.</p>

<p>Could we excuse Mr. Whaley now? There are two pieces of evidence to be
here and they are not here.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Excuse him and we will take the other witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will excuse him and take the other witness.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Whaley, will you wait outside until we get the other
exhibits and we will finish with you very shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. McWatters, would you be seated please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission is meeting today to take further testimony
concerning the events surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy, and
it is our understanding that you have some information that would bear on
that subject, and that is the reason for our asking you to come here and testify.</p>

<p>Would you raise your right hand to be sworn please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission will
be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>.   I do.</p>

<h2 id="cjm">TESTIMONY OF CECIL J. McWATTERS</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Would you be seated please, and Mr. Ball will conduct the
interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. McWatters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I am a bus driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been a bus driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Let's see, this coming September will be 19 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whom do you work for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The Dallas Transit Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you worked for the Dallas Transit Company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It will be 19 years in September, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 2523 Blyth Drive, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22,1963, were you on duty as a driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a bus were you driving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I was driving a 44-passenger, let's see, it is a 44-passenger
city bus made by White, I believe is the maker of the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What hours of work were you assigned that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I was assigned that day on the particular run from
11:52 until 2:27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Do you mean the name of the run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What course did you take, what part of Dallas did you drive in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I went <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Describe it generally, you don't need to go into any detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I would say from northeast Dallas in the Lakewood addition
of Dallas to the Oak Cliff addition of Dallas, which is, would be southwest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would that be northeast to southwest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a place near the downtown area of Dallas where you
timed your run, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I have after I get into town, when I get into the
downtown part of it, now St. Paul Street is my official time point going in,
where they have a supervisor that stays at this checkpoint there, to check all
incoming vehicles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You would be coming in from northeast Dallas at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I am coming in from the Lakewood addition of
Dallas, which I came in on. The main thoroughfare is Gaston Avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you got to the intersection of what street and St. Paul when
you were timed by your dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is Elm, Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Elm and St. Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Elm and St. Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you are ahead of time do you stop there until you are assigned
a time to get in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, sir; no sir; you don't&mdash;a man he has his watch and
schedule. If you are ahead of your schedule he will come out and stop you,
in other words, and ask you if your watch is right or what is it, you know, the
idea of you being there. There is no excuse, you know for a man being ahead
of his schedule.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you are ahead of your schedule does he stop you there until you
leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time are you due, according to your schedule, to leave the
corner of St. Paul and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 12:36.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you leave there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I left there that day on time because coming into town
that day, I guess everybody done went to, down to, see the parade, I didn't have
over four or five passengers coming into downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you ahead of your schedule?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I stopped about a block before&mdash;now, just a block
before we get to St. Paul, there is a big theater there, and it has all loading
zones, no parking there and a lot of times if we are a minute or two ahead of
our schedule when we pull in in front of this theater before we get there in
time, in other words, we kill a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do this day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I was a little ahead of my schedule and I killed about
a minute, I guess, before I went to cross St. Paul Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After your dispatcher checked you in what time did you leave
that corner of St. Paul and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, the best I can remember I don't recall even picking
up a passenger there. I think I discharged one lady passenger there on that, to
the best I can recall, because I remember that I had, when I crossed Field Street,
I think I had five passengers on my bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well then, back to the question, what time did you leave that day,
leave Elm and St. Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I would have to say I left there around, in other
words, 12:36 because I know I was on good time when I come in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you think you left at the time you were supposed to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I am almost positive I did, because, as I say, we
generally come in on schedules on good time because from that street on is
where we generally&mdash;for the next seven or eight blocks&mdash;is where we get all
of our passengers going through the downtown area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard any sirens before you got to St. Paul and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know if your dispatcher keeps a written record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The only way he keeps a written record is if you are ahead
of your schedule. He has a little pad, and if a man is ahead of his schedule, in
other words, he writes, of course, we all go by badge numbers, in other words,
he would write your badge number, your bus number, and if you was ahead of
schedule he would write how much ahead of schedule you were, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you think he did anything, did he write anything up on you on
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; the guy that we have down there now, if you are
ahead of schedule he will come out, in other words, because he stands on the
corner all the time, and if you are a minute or two ahead of your schedule he
will come out and if nothing else, converse with you for a minute or two to see
that you leave it on time and very seldom, I mean, if ever&mdash;of course, a report
goes in on you, it goes against your record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, if he did make a record it would be by way of a
reprimand to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you went on down Elm you left your post at St. Paul and Elm,
did you hear any sirens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pick up any passengers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I picked up within a period of from the time I picked up two
or three passengers, I can't recall just exactly which stop. I have after I leave
St. Paul Street, I have Ervay Street and Akard Street, and Field Street which
would be three stops where I can't recall that, exactly where I discharged or
picked up passengers, because I had the few passengers that I had which I came
into town with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well then, do you remember picking up a passenger at a place other
than at a bus stop as you went down Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>As I left Field Street, I pulled out into the, in other words, the first lane of
traffic and traffic was beginning to back up then; in other words, it was blocked
further down the street, and after I pulled out in it for a short distance there
I come to a complete stop, and when I did, someone come up and beat on the
door of the bus, and that is about even with Griffin Street.</p>

<p>In other words, it is a street that dead ends into Elm Street which there is
no bus stop at this street, because I stopped across Field Street in the middle of
the intersection and it is just a short distance onto Griffin Street, and that is
when someone, a man, came up and knocked on the door of the bus, and I
opened the door of the bus and he got on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were beyond Field and before you got to Griffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right. It was along about even with Griffin Street
before I was stopped in the traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is about seven or eight blocks from the Texas Book
Depository Building, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir. It would be seven, I would say that is seven, it
would be about seven blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. From there, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did the man look like who knocked on your door and got on
your bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I didn't pay any particular attention to him. He was
to me just dressed in what I would call work clothes, just some type of little old
jacket on, and I didn't pay any particular attention to the man when he got on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Paid his fare, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; he just paid his fare and sat down on the second
cross seat on the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether or not you gave him a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Not when he got on; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't. Did you ever give him a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I gave him one about two blocks from where he got
on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ask you for a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what he said to you when he asked you for the
transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, the reason I recall the incident, I had&mdash;there was a
lady that when I stopped in this traffic, there was a lady who had a suitcase and
she said, "I have got to make a 1 o'clock train at Union Station," and she said,
"I don't believe&mdash;from the looks of this traffic you are going to be held up."</p>

<p>She said, "Would you give me a transfer and I am going to walk on down,"
which is about from where I was at that time about 7 or 8 blocks to Union
Station and she asked me if I would give her a transfer in case I did get through
the traffic if I would pick her up on the way.</p>

<p>So, I said, "I sure will." So I gave her a transfer and opened the door and
as she was going out the gentleman I had picked up about 2 blocks asked for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
transfer and got off at the same place in the middle of the block where the lady
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that near, what intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It was the intersection near Lamar Street, it was near
Poydras and Lamar Street. It is a short block, but the main intersection there
is Lamar Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had been on the bus about 2 blocks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. About 2 blocks; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Up to that time had you heard any sirens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Not up until&mdash;now just about the time that, let's see, that
is when I left Griffin, right about the time this gentleman got on the bus the
traffic was starting and that was about the first that I can recall of hearing the
sirens, but when, in other words, when they started it seemed to me like they
was coming from all over town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have a radio in your bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear a radio from nearby cars announcing anything about
the President's assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, there was cars that were stopped alongside of the
bus and I think someone raised the window but I couldn't hear. I never did
hear anything outside of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you first heard the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I was sitting in the bus, there was some gentleman in
front of me in a car, and he came back and walked up to the bus and I opened
the door and he said, "I have heard over my radio in my car that the President
has been&mdash;" I believe he used the word&mdash;"has been shot."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that when you were stalled in traffic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right. That is when I was stalled right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that before or after the man got off the bus that asked for the
transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That was before. In other words, at that time no one had
gotten off the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your location then, near what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Between Poydras and Lamar, in other words, because I stayed
stopped there for, I guess oh, 3 or 4 minutes anyway before I made any progress
at that one stop right there and that is where the gentleman got off the bus. In
fact, I was talking to the man, the man that come out of the car; in other words,
he just stepped up in the door of the bus, and was telling me that what he had
heard over his radio and that is when the lady who was standing there decided
she would walk and when the other gentleman decided he would also get off at
that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that point.</p>

<p>What course did you take after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I still was going west, in other words, in the same direction,
going west, in other words, towards Houston Street. In other words, I
went there before I changed my course which was about, I would say, three or
four blocks.</p>

<p>When I got to Houston Street, in other words, I turned to the left, which
would be <span class="locked">south&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went by the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I turned at the corner of Elm Street and Houston
which this book store is on the opposite corner from where I changed course
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was traffic still heavy along there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; the traffic was still tied up, but the police, they
opened up a lane there, they had so many buses and everything that was tied up,
they opened up, moved traffic around that they run quite a few of these buses
through there.</p>

<p>In other words, from two blocks on this side of where the incident happened
they had, in other words, they was turning all the traffic to the right and to
the left, in other words, north and south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went on down to Houston viaduct then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, I turned after they finally let&mdash;they weren't letting any
cars through at that time but they just run a bunch of those buses through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there a bus stop in front of the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>, Where do you stop for that intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, you stop, in other words, on this side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stop on the south side of, the southeast corner of the intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>In other words, like you would be going, direct south towards the Building, the
bus stop is on this corner over here on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the corner of Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which corner, north, south, east, west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, it would be on the north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. North.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. On the north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is a map and maybe you can show us where the bus stop is.
This is Exhibit No. 371.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, this is south, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is west. You are going west on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, I am going&mdash;right here is where the police
had all traffic, they wasn't allowing anything to go any further than Market
Street here.</p>

<p>In other words, all the traffic there they were moving was turning either to
the right or left, on Market Street. But after they held us up there so long,
of course, they run these buses in this right lane here and they did open up
and let a bunch of these buses go right on down here to Houston, of course,
a lot of them go straight on and a lot of them turn left to Houston Street, a lot
of them go under the underpass here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait a minute, you turned to the left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I turned to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, my last stop, in other words at this corner
right here on Record Street, all buses turning to the left have to stop at this
corner right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At Record and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. At Record and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have a bus stop at Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; there is a bus stop there for the buses that go on
under the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there a bus stop for the buses that go south on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; all the buses, we have to get in, this is a one-way
street and you have to get over in this lane here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By the lane you mean the extreme left lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The extreme left lane to <span class="locked">make&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To make the left turn south on Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And your last bus stop, as you go west on Elm and before you
turn is the northeast corner of Record and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went on over to Houston Viaduct into the Oak Cliff section,
didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; to the Oak Cliff section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And there was some conversation occurred on that bus that you
told the FBI officers about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us what that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, there was a teenage boy, I would say 17 or 18 years
of age, who was sitting to my right on the first cross seat and me and him had,
we had conversationed a little while we was tied up in the traffic, you know, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the fact of we wondered where all, what all the excitement was due to the fact
of the sirens and others, and after I turned on Houston Street I said to him and
I made the remark, I wonder where the President was shot, and I believe he
made the remark that it was probably in the head if he was in a convertible
or something to that effect. I don't remember just exactly the way we worded
it or what it was, but it was a conversation about the President, in other words,
to where he was shot.</p>

<p>In other words, and he made the remark or something, he was probably shot
in the head, if he was sitting in a convertible or to that effect. I really don't
know just exactly at that time. Just like I say I never thought anything about
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Didn't some lady say something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Now, as we got on out on Marsalis, along about it was either Edgemont or
Vermont, I believe it was Vermont Street, there was a lady who was fixing to
cross the intersection and I stopped and asked her if she was going to catch the
bus into town from the opposite direction, and she said that she was and I told
her that we was off schedule, that the other bus had done went into town, and
I asked her did she care to just ride on to the end of the line and come back
and she wouldn't have to stand there and wait, and she was getting on, and
I asked her had she heard the news of the President being shot, at the time that
was all I knew about it, and she said, "No, what are you&mdash;you are just kidding
me."</p>

<p>I said, "No, I really am not kidding you." I said, "It is the truth from all
the reliable sources that we have come in contact with," and this teenage boy
sitting on the side, I said "Well, now, if you think I am kidding you," I said,
"Ask this gentleman sitting over here," and he kind of, I don't know whether
it was a grinning or smile or whatever expression it was, and she said, "I know
you are kidding now, because he laughed or grinned or made some remark to
that effect."</p>

<p>And I just told her no it wasn't no kidding matter, but that was part of the
conversation that was said at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was this teenage boy&mdash;do you know where this teenage boy got on
the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; he got on at between, he got on at the stop, in
other words, I stopped in front of the Majestic theater which is a block before
I get to St. Paul; in other words, it is a middle of the stop, block stop, in other
words. We pull in and stop in the center of the block, and my next stop would
be St. Paul; in other words, that is where the teenage boy got on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was on the bus when this man knocked on the door of your
bus and got on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was on the bus when the man asked for the transfer and got off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you later called down to the&mdash;did the teenage boy ask for any
transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you were called down to the Dallas police department later,
weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What day was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It was on the same day, the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 22d. Do you know how they happened to get in touch with you,
did you notify them that <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; I didn't know anything to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they come out and get you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. They come out <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they ask you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, they stopped me; it was, I would say around 6:15 or
somewhere around 6:15 or 6:20 that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were still on duty, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Still on your bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I was on duty but I was on a different line and a different
bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they ask you when they came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, they stopped me right by the city hall there when I
come by there and they wanted me to come in, they wanted to ask me some
questions. And I don't know what it was about or anything until I got in there
and they told me what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, they told me that they had a transfer that I had
issued that was cut for Lamar Street at 1 o'clock, and they wanted to know if
I knew anything about it. And I, after I looked at the transfer and my punch,
I said yes, that is the transfer I issued because it had my punch mark on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did your punch mark have a distinctive mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It had a distinctive mark and it is registered, in other words,
all the drivers, every driver has a different punch mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What makes it different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, it is, it would be, the symbol of it or angle, in other
words, every one; it is different, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have a punch there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I have the punch right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the punch that you used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is the punch I used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you punch a piece of paper and show us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, that is the type of punch that this one
makes right here, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is a different type of punch than any other driver has?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Any driver, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On any bus in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, the superintendent has a list, in other words,
it would be just like this and every man has a punch and he has his name, and
everything. In other words, if anyone calls in about a transfer or anything, I
mean brings one in he can look right down the list by the punch mark and tell
whose punch it is, and who it is registered to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the sample of your punch there has been on a piece of paper
and we would like to have it marked as 372 at this time.</p>

<p>(The paper referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 372 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you punched, made a punch mark, on a transfer, did you designate
the time of the punch or the place of the punch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I designate the time of the&mdash;we have one general
transfer point. In other words, Lamar Street is what we call our general transfer
point in which all transfers are cut within the quarter of the hour in which you
are supposed to be there.</p>

<p>In other words, if you was to arrive there at, say, 12:50 or in that vicinity,
you always give the passenger the 15 minutes, in other words, within the hour
of the transfer. In other words, is the way they have you to cut your transfers
across your cutter.</p>

<p>In other words, it is just a little thing that you raise up and down and you
can adjust them, and right here is a book of them in which you can see the
time. It is one, in other words, 2:15, 3:30, and 4:45, and we set them in
other words, if you wanted at 1:15, 1 o'clock would be across this direction.
If you wanted it 1:15 you would cut across this direction or if you wanted it
1:45 you would cut it in this direction. In other words, 1:15, -:30 and -:45. In
other words, the 15 minutes is always given at the time, at the general transfer
point.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is 10:25 now. How would you cut it right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. At 10:25.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Why don't you cut one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I have a regular cutter, you see; let's see if he can get something
that would&mdash;in other words, 10:25, I will just cut it, in other words, cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
across there, and cut it, in other words, at 10:30, in other words, it would
show at 10:30.</p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where do you put your own identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. On here. Well, if it is in the morning or in the afternoon,
here is your a.m., or your p.m. In other words, it is before 12:45, in other
words, we consider up to 12:45 a.m., in other words, that is the way they are.</p>

<p>In other words, I would punch it in the a.m. side of it, and if it was in the
afternoon, in other words, after that, it would be a p.m. transfer, and whatever
line that you are working has the name on it right here.</p>

<p>In other words, at that time that transfer I had punched was punched a p.m.
Lakewood, in other words, because I was coming from the Lakewood addition is
the way that was punched on the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well now, do you punch the transfer when the passenger asks for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No. No, sir; in other words, when you leave this, you are
inbound when you are going into town or when you are going, in other words,
out of town, in other words.</p>

<p>I was coming in, in other words, when I got in Lakewood Addition I set my
transfers for downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For downtown and you set them for what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I set them for 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You set them for 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you reached your end of the run in northeast Dallas then
you set your transfers for 1 o'clock, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, when I was coming back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when you gave this transfer near Poydras and <span class="locked">Elm&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pull out a transfer that had already been set for 1 o'clock
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir. In other words, I just reached up on my cutter and
just tore off one which is already punched.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did you punch it again or was it already punched?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It was already punched.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had punched it at the end of the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So all you had to do is pull the transfer off of the pile of transfers
and hand it to the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had anticipated at the end of the line that when you
got to about this point it would be a 1 o'clock transfer, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, that is right.</p>

<p>In other words, there is enough time on it, just like I say, within a quarter of
an hour, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got to the police station that day did they show you
a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell them about the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I recognized the transfer as being the transfer that
I had issued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you recognize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. By my punch mark on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what about the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Lakewood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The Lakewood punch on it, and where it was punched and
Lakewood with my punch mark on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you able to identify it any further as a particular transfer
you had given to any particular passenger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir. <span class="locked">Only&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I only gave two transfers going through town on that trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
and that was at the one stop of where I gave the lady and the gentleman that
got off the bus, I issued two transfers. But that was the only two transfers
that were issued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell the police in Dallas that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I don't remember whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you do remember it now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(At this point Chief Justice Warren left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Now, what else did you do that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, let's <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they show you any prisoner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; when they stopped me over there and took me
into the police department there, like I say, it was around 6:15 or 6:20, they
took me down before the lineup there and asked me if I could identify anyone
in that lineup as getting on my bus that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they take you down and show you a lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You sat there with police officers and they brought men in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. They brought four men out. In other words, four men under
the lights; in other words, they was <span class="locked">all&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All the same age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; they were different ages, different sizes and different
heights. And they asked me if I could identify any man in particular there,
and I told them that I couldn't identify any man in particular, but there was
one man there that was about the size of the man. Now, I was referring back,
after they done showed me this transfer at that time and I knew which trip,
that I went through town on at that time, in other words, on the Lakewood
trip and just like I recalled, I only put out two transfers and I told them that
there was one man in the lineup was about the size and the height and complexion
of a man that got on my bus, but as far as positively identifying the
man I could not do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the size and the height and complexion of the man
that knocked on the window of this bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I would say, just like I told the police, to me he was
just a medium-sized man. To me he was, I would say, not, I wouldn't call
him&mdash;just of average weight, and I would say a light-complected, to the best of
my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you say "average weight" what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I figured just like I saw, the man, he looked like to me the
best way I can describe him would be 135 or 140 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about height?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, just like I told them, it looked like to me he would
probably be five-seven or five-eight, in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anyway, you were not able to identify any man in the lineup as the
passenger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As the passenger who had gotten on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said there was one man who closely resembled in height, weight
and color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Just like I told them, I didn't know who was who or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever learn who that person was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I don't know whether that was really the man or not,
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Now, I have a map here.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. All right, proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You remember you told us about the man that knocked on the
window of the door of your bus just before you got to Griffin, wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; along about the vicinity of Griffin Street, it comes
to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You let him on the bus, and he paid his fare, how much is that fare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It is 23 cents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 23 cents, and you went about down almost to Poydras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Almost, between Poydras and Lamar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Between Poydras and Lamar, closer to Lamar than to Poydras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And a man got on. Was it the same man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That was the same man who got on the bus that I picked
up, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the man you gave the transfer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The man I gave the transfer to when the woman&mdash;in other
words, when the man that got on Griffin Street there got off at the same place
she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he was only on the bus about 2 blocks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Two blocks was the only distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did it take you to go those 2 blocks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Now, he paid as far as from St. Paul Street. I made&mdash;there
wasn't any traffic holding me up whatsoever, I come on right down to where I
picked the man up there, in other words, about Field, and that is where the
traffic was starting to back up to. So the best of my knowledge I would say it
took me 3 or 4 minutes to get down there, so I will just have to say it was in
the vicinity of around 12:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, how long was the man on your bus, the man who
got on, about Griffin and got off and you gave him the transfer, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, he got on, and when he got on, I made that one block,
and then the other, well, I would be safe in saying he wasn't on there 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you think he got off or on around 12:40?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 12:40 that is the best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you say he got on approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. On the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I would say in the vicinity from where I left up there
it would be probably it took me, I would say, 3 minutes to come, let's see, it
would be Ervay, Akard and Field, that is about 3 blocks there where I left my
time point which I would say just a rough estimation it would be with no traffic
would be 2 or 3 minutes, I would say 3 minutes anyway.</p>

<p>So, it must have been somewheres 12:39 or&mdash;so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he got on the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 12:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then he was on the bus about how many minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, just like I say he wasn't on the bus over 4 or 5 minutes,
in other words, just made that 1 block there, and in other words, when the traffic
stopped, well, that is when he got off the bus.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. During the time he was on the bus this man rapped at
your door or was your door open, and spoke up and said that the President had
been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He was on the bus, you mean was the door open?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. You previously testified that while you were stalled
or jammed up in the <span class="locked">traffic&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A man came to the door of the bus and indicated by
word of <span class="locked">mouth&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That the President had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, was the man to whom you issued the transfer on
the bus at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, the man who spoke up and said that the President
had been shot, how loudly did he say that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, he said it loud enough that I guess everybody on the
bus heard him when he stepped up in the bus.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, that would be your best impression or
best recollection that whoever said this, that the President had been shot, said
it loudly enough for not only you but the other bus passengers to hear it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir. Because he stepped up in the bus and when he
made the statement in other words, he said that the President had been shot,
because I am pretty sure everybody&mdash;he said it to the fact. I think that everybody,
there might have been some, if there was anybody in the extreme back
of the bus, might not have heard it, but I think anyone who was near the front
part of the bus could have.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But at that time when this man made this statement,
there was a teenager sitting in the first cross seat on the right-hand side of
the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And the man who had gotten on the bus to whom you
later issued the transfer, was sitting in the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In the second seat.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What is the distance from the door of the bus where
the man was standing who made this statement to the second cross seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I would say, let's see, it would be I would say 6 or 8
feet.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was he sitting alone in the second cross seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He was sitting alone.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you notice any reaction on the part of any of your
passengers to this comment by this man who made this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, the only reaction that I knew is when he got up and
said that, well, that is when the lady got off first, which she jumped up and
got her suitcase and said, in other words, made a remark to something. "I am
afraid you are going to be tied up here in this traffic and I want to get off."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where was this lady sitting who got up and asked for
this transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Now, this lady was sitting behind me, in other words, I
am the driver.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On the left-hand side of the bus looking forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; in other words, it is a cross seat. I mean a side
seat, in other words, like the driver sitting here, the first seat is the one that
runs parallel with the bus, in other words.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well now, the seat in which the lady was sitting would
be parallel to the second cross seat on the other side of the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, in other <span class="locked">words&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It would be on the same line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The first seat would be ahead&mdash;the first seat on the
right-hand side of the bus would be ahead of the seat where the lady was sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, you mean the lady, I am referring to who got off first?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, the lady&mdash;I was sitting in the driver's seat, she was
sitting right behind me, in other words, facing out his way.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But she obviously heard what the man said about the
President being shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There is no doubt in your mind she heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I wouldn't think so because when she got up and stated
she wanted to get <span class="locked">off&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was she any further from the man who made this statement
about the President being shot than the man who was sitting in the second
cross seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. She was closer to the man actually than the man that
got off with her was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How many feet or how much difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, the lady in other words, from the door here, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
just two cross seats, and two seats where you sit sideways and then the two
seats in which he would be back here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you diagram that as best as you can?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Congressman, we have a diagram. We have a picture of the
side of the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Sit down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. You can see it from this point right here, in other words.
You see this cross seat, in other words, these first two right here, the driver's
seat, you see the first two seats there, in other words.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you sit down and mark it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. This is the inside, let's see, this is the driver right here.
Here is your cross seat right here. Here, about back here, is where the lady
got off who was sitting on this seat.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Will you mark that with an "L"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, right here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where was the man in the first cross seat sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Right here is the first. Right here is where the man that
was sitting, got off, in this seat right here, I believe it is.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Will you mark that "M" where the man who was
sitting also got off who got the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Maybe we had better use a black pen that will show better on
that glazed surface.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is where the man was sitting who you issued
the transfer to at the same time the lady was issued the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And the teenager was sitting in what seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Will you mark that "O"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where was the man standing who came to the bus and
said the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On the step?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. On the step. I guess, I presume this would be the second
step there. To the best of my recollection he stepped up on the first step.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mark that "P."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. "P."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, after the man who was standing at "P" said the
President was shot, what did the lady do who was sitting in "L"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, the lady, she had a suitcase sitting right there beside
me and she left. When the lady got up and said she would like to get off the
bus, and that she was going to walk to the Union Station and asked me if I
would give her a transfer in case that I caught up with her, and asked me if I
would pick her up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You gave her a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. She got off and by the time when she was talking to me
that is when he got up, this gentleman here in the seat got up, at seat "M" got
off. In other words, the door was never closed of the bus from the time the
gentleman stepped up in the door of that there, in other words, when he said
what he did, and got on back in his car, in other words, the lady got off, and
the man got off, too, both at the same stop.</p>

<p>In other words, the bus hadn't moved at that stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to mark this as the next exhibit, Commission's exhibit,
which will be the diagram of the bus with the initials "M," "O," "L," "P," will
be marked as Commission's Exhibit 373.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It will be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The diagram referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 373 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And a photograph of the interior of the bus, I would like to have
marked as 374.</p>

<p>And a diagram of the bus itself showing front and side as 375.</p>

<p>(The photograph and diagram referred to were marked Commission Exhibits
Nos. 374 and 375, respectively, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will hand you a photograph of the exterior of the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; in other words, that is the same bus number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is the bus it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the bus. <span class="locked">Number&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 433.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. These are all admitted.</p>

<p>Now, we have this map which is Commission's Exhibit 371. Can you
show me your starting point which is where you started your time on Elm and
what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is Elm and St. Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you mark an "X" there with your black pen, or let's take red
pen this time for you, on this same map, here it is right there, that is where
you commenced your time, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an "O" there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Put an "O" here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just circle that intersection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. O.K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you went along Elm, westerly along Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is <span class="locked">right&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a "P" about the place where the man knocked on the window
of your door of your bus and got on. Here is Griffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. This is Griffin right here, mark that with a "P".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And put an "R" at the place where the man got off the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Let's see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Lamar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Here is Lamar here. I want to find Poydras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That would be, in other words, about the center here
would be, in other words, a little bit closer to Lamar <span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an "R" there to indicate the approximate position where he
got off.</p>

<p>"O" is where you started, so you had better raise those up to Elm. The place
he got on and the place he got off.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if you would just draw a line up and put your "R" it would be easier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. On Griffin here now that is where you <span class="locked">want&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where he got on, wherever it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Is that where you want the "P"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is where he got on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes. O.K. right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where he got off "R".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is a very short block right in between Poydras and
Lamar here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, let's use the map here. You made your start at St. Paul and Elm
didn't you, and went west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you picked up a man who knocked on the window of your
bus at a place in the street that was not a bus stop, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And its approximate location was where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. At Griffin Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have marked that as "P"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Marked that as "P".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That same man stayed on your bus until you got to what location</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, the location was between Poydras and Lamar Street.</p>

<p>In other words, I would say closer to Lamar than to Poydras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that point he got off the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He got off the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you gave him a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have marked that "R", is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is another map I would like to show you that hasn't been
marked yet as a Commission Exhibit, and I will have that marked as 376, a map
of Dallas.</p>

<p>You have already marked on this map, haven't you, or it has been marked in
advance then by someone.</p>

<p>(The map referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 376 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, take a look at this map and tell me if that map, the blue
line on the map, indicates your route on that day, where you started in northeast
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, that is the original starting line there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I believe&mdash;I can't even see that small print on that. That
is Ellsworth and Anita, that is where it is coming back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ellsworth and Anita, and then you proceeded downtown along that
course, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir. This is Lakewood shopping center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have an alternative route through there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, in other words, that is where the main thoroughfare
starts right there at Gaston Avenue. Gaston right here which is the main
street when you leave this shopping center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went down Gaston to Pacific?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Went down Gaston to, let's see this is Hawkins Street
right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went left on Hawkins to Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. To Elm Street, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Went from Elm to, this would be Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Turned on Houston Street viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Left on Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To Marsalis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, this is the Houston Street viaduct and this
is Marsalis where you turn and come off Houston Street viaduct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you go south how far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Go south all the way to, let's see, it is Ann Arbor. This
is all Marsalis right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A straight run south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Straight run.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you make a turn and go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I make a turn, in other words, on Ann Arbor and in other
words, just circle, make a loop, just circle right around this little shopping
center here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. And right back down Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Marsalis is how far from Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Marsalis is, let's <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Beckley here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You can count the streets there, can you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, it would be seven blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Seven blocks, Beckley is seven blocks west of Marsalis, is that
correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your bus line doesn't run down Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It doesn't run seven blocks, close to Beckley? Have you seen
this? Here is Beckley and here is Marsalis, the bus line.</p>

<p>Is there a bus route on Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you get a bus that goes down Beckley some place around
Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; the bus comes, the Beckley bus comes in on St.
Paul and Elm, in other words, at the time that I was, before we started, in
other words, that is where the Beckley bus enters Elm Street there and then
he goes the same route through town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same route you go down to the Houston viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes. In other words, after the Book Depository down there,
he goes straight on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me ask you this: The Beckley bus, the bus that will take you
south on Beckley, has a starting point the same place as yours at St. Paul
and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. St. Paul, in other words, the time element is the same. In
other words, he comes in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then that Beckley bus goes west on Elm the same as your bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But instead of turning south on the Houston Street viaduct the
Beckley bus goes straight west on Elm, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you show us the bus stop for the Beckley bus on this Commission
Exhibit No. 361?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, yes; his last bus stop would be right here at the
corner <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's put a mark on this. Here is a red pencil, and put a mark on
this in red and show us the place where the Beckley bus would stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It would stop&mdash;in other words, we consider this corner of
this intersection right here, any letter or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just put a rectangular mark about the size of a bus indicating bus
stop&mdash;take black ink and indicating a place where the bus would stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, the bus would stop along in this place right
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, now that is bus stop for Beckley bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is bus stop for Beckley bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Northeast corner Houston and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Northeast corner of Houston and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The Beckley bus goes on across directly in front of the Texas
School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As your bus gets into another lane of traffic and does not stop at
Houston and Elm and makes a turn south on Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then the Beckley bus stop, the stop of the Beckley bus, which is
in black ink on the northeast corner of Houston and Elm, we will mark that
with a big "B" which stands for Beckley bus.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How long have you been on this run that you had the
day of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I worked this run for, I would say, this is the second year.
This makes 2 years that I worked this.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Two years consecutively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 2 years consecutively that I have been on this run and
worked it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So you would be familiar with the route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; just like I say, I worked it, this is the second year
that I have worked the same, in other words, the same hours, and the same route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How many hours a day do you work this route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, now, this one particular route right here, I work it
only 2 hours and 35 minutes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Each day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Each day.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How many days a week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. 5 days, Monday through Friday. And after that, in other
words, I work on another, a different bus line.</p>

<p>But this one particular one here is just 2 hours and 35 minutes each day.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say a different bus line, you mean the same
company but a different route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. A different route.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You would be familiar with the time schedules and all
of the stops on this particular route from your 2 years' experience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you testified that you saw this passenger whom you
later recognized in the lineup, get on the bus in the vicinity of Murphy Street&mdash;is
Murphy Street on your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Murphy Street is the street that, in other words, that comes
in.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Does it run into Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It runs into Elm Street, it dead ends, in other words, into
Elm Street.</p>

<p>Here is Field Street, in other words, across this intersection and we stopped
across the intersection of Field, and Murphy Street comes in to the intersection
at about where the bus stops, in other words, where Field Street stops and I
guess that Griffin is the next small street that comes in just, it is just a short
distance below.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Well, did the passenger that you have testified about, and
whom you stated that you later identified, did he get on in the vicinity of
Murphy Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Murphy Street&mdash;you proceeded from Murphy Street toward
the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was the passenger that got on near Murphy Street the same
passenger that you later have testified about who told you that the President
had been shot in the temple?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, they told me later that it was, but at the time they
didn't tell me.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Who didn't tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The police didn't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When you say this passenger got on near Murphy Street,
was there anything about him that caused you to take notice of him particularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, no, sir. I wouldn't say there was. He was, I would
say, he didn't have on no suit or anything, he had on, I believe, some type of
jacket, cloth jacket.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What caused you to remember him getting on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. What caused me to remember?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes; at the time he got on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Because, the reason I remembered exactly because I didn't
put out but two transfers, and that, in other words, from where he got on and
everything, I didn't have but one, there wasn't but one man on the bus and that
was the teenage boy, when he got on the bus, in other words, when he got off,
he was the only man except the teenage boy who was on the bus at the time.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Now was this man that you saw got on the bus the same one
who told you that the President had been shot in the temple?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The man who got on the bus now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes. The man to whom you have just referred as getting
on the bus near Murphy Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is he the same man who told you that the President had been
shot in the temple?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. A man in an automobile in front of me, in other words, that
was sitting in a car come back and told me.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Told you what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That the President had been shot, that he had heard over
his radio in his car that the President had been shot.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you have testified that someone, some passenger on
the bus, in response to a question that you had asked, "I wonder where they
shot the President" said, "They shot him in the temple."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Oh, that was now, that was after we had done, that is when
I turned on Houston Street, the conversation with the teenage boy.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It was the teenage boy who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; it was the teenage boy, sitting on his right side
of the side seat there, the one that I conversationed with about the President
being shot in the head or the temple, I don't remember, but the teenage boy was
the one.</p>

<p>That was after the man that already got off that had boarded my bus up
around Griffin there.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Then the one who told you the President had been shot in
the temple was not the one you later identified in the police lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. This probably has been testified to, but where did the man
that you later identified in the police lineup get off the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Got off between Poydras and Lamar Street.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was that after you crossed over the viaduct or before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; that was before I crossed over.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When did the teenage boy get off the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He got off at Oak Cliff, I believe. He got off at Marsalis
and Brownley.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was that after the bus had crossed the viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is after the bus <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Past the Texas Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that is about 3 or 4 miles out in the Oak Cliff
section where the teenage boy got off of the bus.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. From the time the man got on the bus, which you later identified
in the police lineup until he got off, had you noticed him, had you looked
at him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Had I looked at him again?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Not until just like I say he was sitting&mdash;I was talking to
this teenage boy and he was sitting right behind this boy, but I didn't pay him
any particular attention, to the man.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You saw him get on the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see him get off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes; I gave him a transfer when he got off the bus, the
same place that was, the same place I was stopped where the man come back
and stepped up in the bus and told me what he had heard over his radio in his
car, the same place that the lady got off, with a suitcase, is the place that the
man got off.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The man you later identified in the police lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you pay any particular attention to him when he got off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Not no more than I did than, I think, when he got on.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you remember anything about his clothes or his general
appearance in any way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Just like I say, I remember he had on, to me he had on
just work clothes, he didn't have on a suit of clothes, and some type of jacket.
I would say a cloth jacket.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I believe that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't&mdash;as I understand it, when you were at the police lineup,
you told us that you didn't&mdash;weren't able to identify this man in the lineup as the
man who got off, that you gave the transfer to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I told them to the best of my knowledge, I said the man
that I picked out was the same height, about the same height, weight and
description. But as far as actually saying that is the man I <span class="locked">couldn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You couldn't do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I wouldn't do it and I wouldn't do it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You signed an affidavit for the Dallas Police Department, do you
remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you a copy of it, we can get the original if you want,
but there is a copy of it, a picture taken of it.</p>

<p>Will you read it, please?</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This document, I would like to have marked as 377, at this time,
Commission Exhibit, with the understanding that we may substitute the photostat
for the original.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Very well; let it be substituted. It has been identified, and
will be identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, it will be; I will identify it for the record as a photostat of
an affidavit of Cecil J. McWatters made before Patsy Collins, Notary Public
of Dallas County, Tex., November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 377, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, having read that, first of all, does that look like your signature,
Mr. McWatters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember the circumstances under which you made that
affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I just told them the best I could remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am showing this to you for the purpose of refreshing your
memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I know it has been several months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, I know what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And sometimes when you see something that you signed before
it refreshes your memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It sure does.</p>

<p>Yes, that is what you mean, I know what you mean, I said that looked like
the man I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In this affidavit, it says, it mentions the fact that when you went
to Marsalis and picked up a woman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You asked her if she knew the President had been shot, you
told us about that a few moments ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She thought you were kidding, and you told her, "I told her if she
didn't believe me to ask the man behind her, that he had told me the President
was shot in the temple."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the man, was that the teenager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, sir, that was the teenage boy. In other
words, he was, I would say, around 17 or 18 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said here, "The man didn't say anything but he was grinning."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you think that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, when the lady asked him, he just kind of grinned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
in other words, and she said, "This is not a grinning or laughing matter," or
something to that effect I don't remember just exactly what she did say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now you told them at that time you didn't know where you let
this man off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, I didn't at that time, I didn't know where
he got off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told us a few moments ago you thought he got off another
place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was that place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He got off at Brownley, because the man rode with me the
next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went out there the next day, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With an FBI man or a Dallas policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, I <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same teenager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The same teenager rode with me the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you noticed he got off there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, and I noticed, and I asked him, like I told him, I said
that I was&mdash;I thought that, you know, that he was, when he first got on down
there, I says, "From all indications, we had you kind of pinpointed as the man
who might have been mixed up in the assassination and everything." <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do I understand the day after you made the affidavit, this would
be the 23d of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That this same teenager got on your bus again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, he got on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you noticed where you let him off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I noticed where I let him off, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the reason that today you remember he got off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is it today I remember, just like I say, I remember
I talked to him the next day, and he told me where he got on, and he told me
where he got on, and where he got off and where he lived, and, you know
<span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Has he been on your bus since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He has?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He has rode with me since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes. I see.</p>

<p>Did you give him a transfer that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, because he gets on and he lives within about two blocks
of the busline, in other words, where he gets off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know this boy's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I believe his name is Milton Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Milton Jones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Milton Jones. I don't believe I know where he lives, but I
pass where he lives. But he told me his name was Milton Jones and he told me
he was 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever tell you where he works?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He told me that, I believe, he goes to school half a day,
believe he said and I believe he goes home and he has a part-time job, but he
never did state where he works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you where he went to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; he never did tell me where he went to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or where he worked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Where he worked, either one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You notice in the affidavit there it says, "This man"&mdash;referring
to the man who was <span class="locked">grinning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "This man looks like the No. 1 man I saw in the lineup today."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was the No. 2 man you saw in the lineup on November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, just like I say, he was the shortest man in the lineup,
in other words, when they brought these men out there, in other words, he was
about the shortest, and the lightest weight one, I guess, was the reason I say
that he looked like the man, because the rest of them were larger men <span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, at that time, when you saw the <span class="locked">lineup&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you under the impression that this man that you saw in
the lineup and whom you pointed out to the police, was the teenage boy who
had been grinning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I was, yes, sir; I was under the <span class="locked">impression&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That was the fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were not under the impression then that night when you saw
the lineup that the No. 2 man in the lineup was the man who got off the bus, to
whom you had given a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is what I say. In other words, when I told them, I
said, the only way is the man, that he is smaller, in other words, he kind of had
a thin like face and he weighs less than any one of them. The only one I could
identify at all would be the smaller man on account he was the only one who
could come near fitting the description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me ask you this, though. Did you tell them the man, the
smaller man, you saw in the lineup, did you tell them that you thought he was
the man who got off your bus and got the transfer or the man who was on the
bus who was the teenager who was grinning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I really thought he was the man who was on the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That stayed on the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That stayed on the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you didn't think he was the man who got off the bus and to
whom you gave a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that time you didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is why I say I pinpointed that transfer on that boy as
far as that is concerned. But at first, just like I say, I really thought from
the height and weight of the two men, I mean was just like I say, was both of
them were small. In the lineup they had, in other words, bigger men, in other
words, he was the smallest man at the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have got&mdash;we have this diagram that you have already drawn
of the bus which has several initials on it. Could you tell me where on the bus
this lady sat who told the teenager it was no grinning matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, now, that is, in other words, I don't think at that
time&mdash;now this teenager was still on the bus near, but I had a couple of more
passengers on there, I believe I had two women on there, but I can't recall just,
when I picked her up where she sat down on the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember you said to the woman, "Look at that man behind
you?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, she was standing up here at the fare, paying fare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the teenager was where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He was sitting right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the place "O", is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, at the place "O".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is where the conversation was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. McWatters, that affidavit you have there, will you look at
another item you have there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "Today, November 22, 1963, about 12:40 p.m., I was driving Marsalis
Bus No. 1213."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First of all, you have referred to that as another bus, Munger Bus,
is that the same bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; in other words, that number there is my run number
right here on my card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I understand that, but do you call that run the Marsalis run as
well as the Munger run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir. Well, here you can&mdash;let me show you here on this
schedule right here, Marsalis, Ramona, Elwood and Munger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can we take this and have a <span class="locked">Xerox&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. You can just take the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. We will have a Xerox of this and mark it 378, a Xerox
copy.</p>

<p>Will you identify that document and tell me what it is?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 378, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. This is a schedule, I will just say a bus schedule.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is for the Marsalis-Ramona-Elwood-Munger run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Run 1213. Is this the run schedule that was in effect on November
22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It shows here at St. Paul you were to leave at 12:36; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will make a photostat of that and we will give you back the
original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. You can keep that if you want to. They made another
copy of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, then, we will keep this as an original.</p>

<p>Can this be introduced into evidence, Senator?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes, let it be made a part of the evidence.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 378, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a few more questions to ask you, a few more questions, Mr.
McWatters.</p>

<p>Let's look again at this affidavit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "I picked up a man on the lower end of town on Elm around
Houston," as I remember you didn't stop at Elm and Houston; you stopped
at Record and Houston for a pickup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember having picked up any man around the lower
end of town at Elm around Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, no, sir; I didn't pick up. I made a statement here I
picked <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Take a look at it, "I picked up a man on the lower end of town on
Elm around Houston."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, I didn't. I picked&mdash;"I picked a man up at the lower end
of town at Elm," no, sir, I didn't pick up no man.</p>

<p>No, I was tied up in traffic there. Market Street is the&mdash;I must not have
read that very good when I signed that, because I sure didn't. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pick up a man at Record and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; that is not even no stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, this statement is not an accurate statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, sir, because in fact that day the police wouldn't
let nobody, in other words they run them buses through but they wouldn't let
nothing stop there, in other words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's get back to that lineup.</p>

<p>Did you pick out one man or two men that night as people you had seen, as
a person you had seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I picked out, the only one that I told them it was the
short man that I picked out up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you thought he was the teenager whom you described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, first that is what I thought he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now you have named him Milton Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now you realize you were mistaken in your identification that
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As I understand it, neither then nor now are you able to identify
or say that you have again seen the man that got off your bus to whom you
gave a transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; I couldn't. I could not identify him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This Beckley bus that we talked about, remember the one that
has the starting point at St. Paul and <span class="locked">Elm&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same as your bus, the Marsalis bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the difference in the time run, what time does the Beckley
bus leave&mdash;let me withdraw the question.</p>

<p>Your bus leaves St. Paul and Elm at 12:36, scheduled to leave there as of
November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Using the same schedule, can you tell me at what time around
12:30 or so that the Beckley bus would leave Elm and St. Paul and proceed
westerly on Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. He is scheduled in there the same time as I am, 12:36.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 12:36. Was that bus in the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No. In other words, that bus was behind me, in other
words, because when I got there as a general rule, when we pull up there every
day, in other words, I am coming in one direction and he is another, in other
words, most every day, we will pull up at this intersection at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, whichever way the light changes is who gets, in other words, who gets
in front of who. But at that day, I am sure that I was ahead of the Beckley
bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are sure you were ahead of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Because there wasn't another bus in front of me. I was
the first bus down there that was tied up in there in the traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the Beckley bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember whether he was behind you or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I don't remember whether he was behind me or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you transfer from your bus to the Beckley bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; sure can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any particular transfer point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, there are particular transfer points, but we don't
question anybody within the downtown section with a transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you gave a transfer to your bus, then that transfer would be
good on a Beckley bus any place along Elm, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, it sure would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Up to the place where you change courses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It would be accepted; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your course is westerly on Elm, is identical with that of the
Beckley bus between St. Paul and Houston, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And from that point you go south on Houston, and the Beckley bus
continues west on Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So that would be a normal transfer point, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That would be a transfer. In other words, now, like I say,
Lamar is the general transfer point of where all the buses cross.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, that night of the lineup, when you identified this one short
<span class="locked">man&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As being probably the teenager that had been on the <span class="locked">bus&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything unusual in the conduct of anyone in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any man in the lineup talk more than anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, I believe they had a guy that asked them their address,
and they said, "address" and I don't know, he asked them, I believe he asked
some of them where they lived or some or them where they worked, or I don't
remember just what, in other words, he asked some enough, every one of them
to say some few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could hear them talk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; you could hear them talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was any one man boisterous, mean, loud, anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, not that I could tell any difference. They all talked
to me as, in other words, you just asked them their name and address. If they
did, I didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Exhibit No. 376 that I will show you again. You have
indicated on the map the course of your bus south on Marsalis. Is there any
other bus route that goes south on any street east of Marsalis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. You mean that crosses it this way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, goes south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, let's see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there a main highway called Denley? Is there a bus route on
Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir. Bus route on Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That goes south on Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that bus come anywhere near, does that bus run down Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where does it turn to get to Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, it turns, it goes just like the Marsalis bus
here goes, until he <span class="locked">gets&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's start up at Elm here, Elm and Houston now. Does the bus
that goes down Ewing come west on Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does it go by St. Paul and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have a starting point there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; it is a final point for it right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it goes west on Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where does it turn off Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It turns the same place as I do, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. South on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. South on Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then does it go across the Houston Street viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then it turns on, how does it get onto Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It comes on out to Marsalis to, let's see, I have to find the zoo.
That is where it turns right there at the Marsalis Park, and turns and goes over
to Ewing, let's see, what is the name of that&mdash;this bus turns to the left off
Marsalis there, it is a park&mdash;there is a big expressway there and it is the first
street when it crosses over the expressway where it turns off of Marsalis on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Opera. The name of the bus is Ramona, it is the same, in other words, it is the
same line as this other one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As I understand it now the bus that goes down Ewing comes off
the Houston Street viaduct as far as, comes down the Houston Street viaduct
as far as Marsalis, does it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; and it goes south on Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It goes south on Marsalis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it turns over to Ewing, that would be east on Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes; that would be east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At or about what point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, in other words, that is the Marsalis Zoo is where
it is, after you cross the expressway there, it is the first street, Opera is the
name of that and it goes right down to Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then at the corner of 11th, at the intersection of 11th and Marsalis
both buses travel the same route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; they sure do. Both buses travel the same route
to Marsalis and the Ramona bus on that part travel the same route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Probably on the same route.</p>

<p>Now, I show you this document which is the bus schedule of Marsalis-Ramona-Elwood-Munger,
and it shows you leave St. Paul at 12:36 and you arrive at
Lamar 12:40.</p>

<p>The bus transfers are punched you told me for 1 o'clock. We have a transfer
here that you have seen or we will show you in a few minutes as soon as it gets
here, which has a punch mark of 1 o'clock. You told Senator Cooper that
you usually punched within 15 minutes of the time you reached the transfer
points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If that is the case, <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. You mean why did I have it punched at 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Because I punch it p.m. In other words, I have a punch,
I am going to Lakewood, I mean I am going Marsalis and I am going back
Lakewood, so I just take me two books of transfers. Instead of punching one
of them a.m. and one p.m. I just punched them p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you punch within 15 minutes of the time you reach the transfer
points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is the way that the transfers are supposed to be cut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, if you reach Lamar, if you were to reach Lamar at 12:40,
what time, according to the rules should you punch it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I should have punched it at 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 12:45?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. But I would have to punch one book a.m. and another one
p.m., so I just punched both of them p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, what you do is punch on the hour rather than the
45 and 15 minutes usually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, your usual practice is not to punch on the 15-minute
interval, is that right, but to punch on the hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, just like I say within the closest of the hour like that,
in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Suppose today you were wanting to punch some transfers at the
end of the line and you knew you were going to get to Lamar at 12:40. Would
you punch&mdash;what would you punch it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I work that run all the time, I punch at 1 o'clock every day.
As I say I worked it 2 years and as I say in order to keep from punching one
of them a.m. and one p.m., for the difference in the hour there, I just punch
them p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I don't quite understand that. Doesn't your p.m. start at after
12 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, the way the transfers are there, did you notice how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
they was, they run them until&mdash;see how 12:45 there, in other words, that is what
they use that up to a.m. in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is 12:45 a.m., it runs up to a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is what they run it to a.m. In other words, after
12:45 or in there, in other words, everything is punched p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, everything in the hour from 12 on is punched a.m.,
the day time, 12 to one is a.m., 12 to 12:45, for that hour, a transfer good in that
hour is punched a.m., is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, it can be punched a.m. up to, just like 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the next punch is 1 o'clock and that is p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is p.m.; yes, sir. That is the way they have them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The day that you punched this particular transfer,
November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You punched them the same that day as you did every
other day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right. Every day, in other words, I just punch them
p.m. I punch them p.m., and in other words, so it will be just a straight cut
across it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is that the usual practice for all bus drivers to use this
practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The practice they are supposed to cut them within the
quarter of the hour, but in other words, I just have been working that run and
I just, it is p.m., and I just make one trip one way and one back the other, and
so I&mdash;all I carry are two books of transfers and so I just punch two books
p.m., using one going one way at 1 o'clock and the other coming back at 2.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is the practice you have used for 2 years approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right, when I worked that run, in other words, when
I am going one way at 1 o'clock, coming back from the other end of the line I
set them at 2. I am back in there at, my next trip I am back in there at Lamar
Street, I think it is 1:38 but I always just set them at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have a couple of more pictures here. 378 and 379 which are
pictures of the interior of the bus&mdash;Nos. 379 and 380. (Picture marked for
identification as Commission Exhibit No. 374 is the same as Commission Exhibit
No. 379.)</p>

<p>I will first show you 379. Is that a picture of the bus from front to rear of
your bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that is the front and that is the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is 380, is that a picture of the bus taken from the front taken
looking towards the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I offer these in evidence, too.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So admitted.</p>

<p>(The pictures referred to were marked Commission's Exhibits Nos. 379 and
380 and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here an exhibit which I would like to have marked as 381
which can be identified as a transfer issued by Dallas Transit Company, Friday,
November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Do you identify it, can you tell me, if you have ever seen that transfer before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, that is my punch mark right on that there; p.m.</p>

<p>(The transfer was marked Commission Exhibit No. 381 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You issued it, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me when you issued it, on what run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I issued it on Marsalis and Munger line at I would say,
around to the best of my knowledge it would be around 12:40 or somewheres
in that vicinity on November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it has your punch mark, has it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that is my punch mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Identify it punched in the p.m. section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Of the Lakewood column here on the transfer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you punch it exactly? Where were you when you punched
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I punched it before I left the end of the line, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is number 004459, is the transfer number. Entitled "The
Shoppers Transfer." Every transfer has a separate number, has it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; everyone has a separate number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What we would like to do is mark a photostat of the transfer as
381A and substitute the photostat and we can return the transfer to the custody
of the FBI.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The exhibit will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photostat referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 381A and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How many of those transfers did you issue on this
particular run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Up to the time you passed the Texas School Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I really don't know because I didn't, see. I didn't know
anything&mdash;I didn't put out any&mdash;most of the transfers that you put out at this
time or that time of day are for elderly women which get the shopper's transfers,
in other words. It has got a line there, and it entitles them to a free ride back
to where they came from, in other words, and that time of the morning, because
when I get downtown, in other words, you can catch a bus at Elm Street going
to any place that I would go without having a transfer, in other words.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would you have any recollection of how many passengers
you picked up from the beginning of the line to the time that this man got
on at the middle of the block on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, I don't&mdash;I recall that I didn't have very many passengers
that day, because I figured that everybody had done gone to town to
see the parade, to see the President, and it just wasn't what few passengers I
recall was mostly elderly women that was going into town.</p>

<p>I don't recall just how many of them I did have on the bus.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But you did have these two men, the teenager and this
other young man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that were on the bus.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you very specifically recall giving a transfer to this
woman with the suitcase and the man who was in the second seat on the right-hand
side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. On the right side that got off. In other words, to the best of
my knowledge that is the only two transfers that I put out going through town
that I can recall at all, I mean, because I don't recall putting out any more
transfers than those two that I put out when I was held up there in traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. McWatters, on this transfer is the name of Shopper's Transfer.</p>

<p>Does that have any significance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that is what I was telling him. In other words, if
they want a Shoppers; well I put my punch mark in that Shoppers there, which
they cannot use it for a transfer, in other words, any more than other than&mdash;all
the stores, most of them in downtown Dallas, if you buy as much as a dollar's
worth between the period of ten and four in the afternoon they give you a little
white slip which entitled you to ride what is called the Shopper's Pass. It rides
you back, but in other words you have to, a passenger has to, ask for it in other
words.</p>

<p>When they say a Shopper, you take a punch and punch your punch mark where
it says Shoppers, but they are not supposed to use the transfer then to transfer
to another bus. They are supposed, in other words, where it is punched in the
store, get it exchanged for their return fare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, all your transfers have on them printed the word
"Shopper's Transfer"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in order to make it a Shopper's Transfer so that the transfer
can be exchanged for a merchandise coupon to ride home, it has to have your
punch in the Shopper's Transfer area, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is correct, yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know, did you remember, an elderly woman getting on your
bus some place on Elm after you left St. Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember when this man, do you remember when this man
knocked on your window, and you opened your bus and let him on, some place
around Murphy or Griffin and Elm, that an elderly woman got up in the bus
and moved?</p>

<p>Did you see that or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know whether or not you left an elderly woman off down
around in the Oak Cliff area some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The best I can recall I had two or three or four elderly
women, the best I can remember on the bus when I left town, but I don't recall
where any of them got off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know a woman named Mary Bledsoe?</p>

<p>Did you pick anybody up at St. Paul and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I really don't&mdash;I really can't recall whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I would like to ask a few, if I may.</p>

<p>Am I correct in saying that the direction of your bus at the time of these
events you have testified to it was going west on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. West on Elm. In other words, west, the streets of Dallas
all run east and west.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But when you got to Houston Street, then you turned south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I turned south, that is correct.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did your bus pass the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I mean does it pass it directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It doesn't pass it directly, no, sir. In other words, where
I turn to the left on Houston Street, the book store is across on the opposite
corner.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Now, as you reached Lamar Street, or did you reach Lamar
Street on that date before you passed near the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. You mean&mdash;yes, I have to pass Lamar Street before I get
down to there.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Now, this first affidavit you made on November <span class="locked">22&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Which has been referred to in the testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It stated in this affidavit that, "I picked up a man on the
lower end of town on Elm around Houston."</p>

<p>Now, you picked up a man at that time it would have been after you passed
Lamar Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. It would have been after I passed Lamar.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The remainder of the affidavit, which has been made a part
of the <span class="locked">testimony&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Refers to that you picked up a woman and you asked her
if she knew the President had been shot, and then the man&mdash;you asked her then
to speak to the man behind her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. "Who said the President was shot in the temple." Now, then,
this incident that you testified to in this affidavit, was after you had passed
Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was the man that you were talking about in this affidavit
the teenager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. At the time this affidavit was made, were you asked about
any other man who may have been on the run that day at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I don't remember whether I was or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was it then that caused you at some time later to
remember that another man had got on the bus near Murphy and had left the
bus, as you have stated in 2 or 3 blocks in the vicinity of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, just like I say, the best I can remember is the man,
I believe in fact beside the boy, I believe he was the only man on board the bus.
After I got to recall, in other <span class="locked">words&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But what I am asking you is what it was that caused you
to remember the teenager at the time you made this affidavit on the 22d, and
what it was that, why it was that, you didn't at that time speak of the other
man who had got on the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is what I say, it just didn't&mdash;it just doesn't register, I
don't know.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were you asked whether or not any other man was on the
bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I don't remember whether I was or not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When was it that you remembered about the second man
being on the bus, the man that you now state got on around Murphy Street and
got off at Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well. I just studied and tried to remember everything that
I could. In other words, I still, you know, just try to see if I could remember
any incidents or anything that was said or done that I hadn't thought of and
everything.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you stated you did not give the teenager any transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, I don't&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was the fact then that you were shown a transfer by the
police that called your attention to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I guess that would probably <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Another man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That would probably be the reason.</p>

<p>I don't know of any other reason that it would be unless it was the transfer,
that I can recall.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Are you absolutely certain that you did see another man
on that bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Do you mean the day?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. A man other than the teenager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I picked up a man.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Along about Griffin Street that knocked on the door of the
bus.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is that near Murphy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is near Murphy, in other words, Murphy is over here
zig-zags, Griffin zig-zags across to Murphy.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Why was it then that when you made this affidavit, you
wouldn't remember that a man knocked on the door to get in the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Just like I say, I guess it never did dawn on me until I
just got to thinking about it and everything, and I had this boy, I mean was
the one I was referring to in that affidavit right there.</p>

<p>In other words, he was just kind of a slight build, so far as him and Oswald,
I guess they probably somewhere in the same size, I don't know. But I was
mistaken in that, in other words, that was the boy right <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did the police ask you if any man other than the teenager was
on the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I don't recall whether they did or not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you tell the police at that time on the 22d or the Federal
Bureau of Investigation on the 23d about a man knocking on the window and
wanting to get into the bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, I believe I did.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What is it about this transfer that makes you know that
it was a transfer which you issued?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, you look at that old punch mark, I guess as many
times as I have punched <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Does each&mdash;does each driver have a different punch?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you weren't here he showed us his punch and he punched
it for us. He has got his punch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Each driver has a different punch. They all are registered.
In other words, regardless of how many there are&mdash;that is my punch right
there&mdash;there is some shape or form different, just like I say the superintendent
has every man's name and a punch mark right on down, in other words, so
<span class="locked">when&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you know whether the punches are different in the shape
that they make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; no, sir; I don't know anything about that. I
<span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What you are saying is, then, you have punched so many of
these transfer that you recognize your own punch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I can recognize my own punchmark. I don't think there
is supposed to be <span class="locked">another&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is there anything else on the transfer which indicates that
it was one which would be issued on your bus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, except only where it is punched&mdash;in other words, I
come off of Lakewood Boulevard there where that would be the only distinction
right there, is the punchmark and the name of where I have it punched there.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did anyone tell you, either the police or the FBI or any
other officer or any other person, tell you at the time you made your first
affidavit or later that there was another man reported to have been on your bus
and got off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you ever reported to the police the fact that you have
carried as a passenger since November 22d the teenager whom you have now
identified as having the name of Milton Jones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Did I ever report it to the police?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have they ever been back to talk to you any more about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. About this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. They have never been back to me. The only time they have
talked to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you ever <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. I beg pardon?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You saw&mdash;was any of the men in the police lineup ever identified
to you as being Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Any men in <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes, I think you saw the men in the lineup, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Before you were asked to select a man in the lineup, did
the police or any officer identify any one of them as bearing the name of Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; they never stated anything.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Later was he identified to you in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Was he identified to me?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. As being Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, they didn't tell me as far as saying, mentioning any
name Lee Oswald, it was never, the name Lee Oswald, I don't believe was ever
mentioned while we was back there.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you ever see this same man you call No. 2 in the lineup
again&mdash;did you ever go back there after that time and see this same person again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Identified as No. 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; I never did go back any more, that was the only time
I was ever there was the one on November 22, about 6 something in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you seen photographs of a man who is named in those
photographs as being Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Have I saw them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Well, now, you have seen this young man, Milton Jones,
several times since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Now after having seen him several times since then, and
having seen these photographs of the man who is identified as Lee <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Does Milton Jones look like Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, they both, just like I say, about the same height, and
same build, and everything, as far as identifying looking at a man in the face&mdash;of
course, I know him now, distinctly.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But at this time would you identify him as Lee Oswald from
the photographs you have seen of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Right now?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No. At the time, I couldn't then, in other words, even from
the recalling of what I seen him then, I mean just to say that the height and size
of him, no, I wouldn't make the statement that I could now.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Are you certain that you did see some man who knocked on
the window of your door of your bus and wanted to get in your bus at some point
near Murphy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; I am positive about that. There <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You saw that man get off later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Before you got <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Before I got to Lamar Street, between Poydras and Lamar.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. The best I can remember is that is where I issued two transfers.
That is the best I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To clear this matter up with your punch, you have your punch
there, have you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was issued to you by the Dallas Transit Company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that make a different mark in a transfer than any other
punch issued to any other driver in the Dallas Transit Company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is a distinctive mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; it is supposed to be, there is not supposed to be
any driver that has a punch that makes a punchmark like my punch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So your supervisor could take this transfer and compare it with
his list in his office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he could see McWatters issued this transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right; that is the way, if they have any complaint,
any transfers brought in to him, he has a list. When he looked at the punchmark
he knows the man's name, and his badge number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And this document here which is 381, you have identified that
punchmark as the one made by your punch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir; that punchmark was made by that punch right
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, there are on this transfer two punches, there is one in p.m.,
and there is marked punch Lakewood. Now, the p.m., refers to the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But Lakewood refers to a certain location on your run, doesn't
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If this transfer was issued around the Lamar area or St. Paul&mdash;Elm
area, is there any place that you could punch and show that particular
location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You always punch at the end of your destination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, that is the usual procedure on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on one side of Lakewood is Beckley, where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, that is on the opposite of town <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The other side is Capital. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Capital, well, Capital is in north Dallas, I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are those Beckley lines listed on the transfer on your run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. No, sir; I don't&mdash;you mean on the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Well, that is, in other words, we all&mdash;they have so many
of the lines listed, in other words, I believe they have two divisions, I believe
all the buses that work out of the east Dallas division <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We can make this pretty simple. You have on this transfer certain
names. When you are running Marsalis-Ramona-Elwood-Munger, how
many possible punches would&mdash;location punches would you make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. In other words, if I was&mdash;Marsalis when I left the end
of Marsalis out there I would punch my transfer Marsalis, if I left the end
of Ramona I would punch them Ramona. In other words, that is so they
can't ride them, in other words, they can't ride the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Lakewood is at one end of your run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Marsalis-Ramona-Elwood is the other, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So you would punch one of those names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Going that way, while at Marsalis, I would punch the
Lakewood when I would leave Marsalis coming toward Lakewood, I would have
Lakewood on the front of my bus but I would punch the transfer Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. McWatters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McWatters</span>. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>

<h2 id="www2">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM WAYNE WHALEY RESUMED</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Whaley. I have here an exhibit which I will mark 370.</p>

<p>(The document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 370 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 370 is a photostat of a manifest of yours, and it is dated November
22, 1963. I mark this 370. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is the original trip sheet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; in my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will offer this into evidence at this time, and the original trip
sheet as Exhibit No. 382.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So admitted.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibits Nos. 370 and 382 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here a bracelet which is marked 383. Take a look at it
and tell me if you have ever seen it before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; as near as I can tell that is the bracelet he was wearing
the day I carried him, the shiny bracelet I was talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mentioned the fact that the man who sat in the front seat
of your cab, which you drove from the Greyhound Station on Lamar Street
over to 500 North Beckley, had an identification bracelet on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, it looked like an identification bracelet. It looks like this
one, sir, it was shiny, I couldn't tell exactly whether that was the bracelet or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But it looks like one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; it looks like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Offer this in evidence.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So admitted.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 383 was withdrawn and a photograph of the bracelet
was received as Commission Exhibit No. 383-A.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What hand or what arm did he have it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He had it on the arm next to me, which was the left arm.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it protruding below the sleeve or jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. His coatsleeve was like this when he stretches his arm out it
was short, that is when I saw it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where was his hand when you saw it, if you can
recollect it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, just moving. You know you catch any bright object, why
you notice it, that is how I noticed it. He was just moving his hand around.
When the old lady stuck her head in the door and asked me to call her a cab,
why he reached over to the door to open it like he told her she could have
that one but she decided that she would wait for the next one because he
already had that one. And that is when I saw it, sir.</p>

<p>In the picture, I believe, I don't think he had it on in that picture in the
paper the next morning.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is something you clearly noticed while he was
riding in the car with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; I noticed it; yes, sir. I always notice watchbands,
unusual watchbands, and identification bracelets like these, because I make
them myself. I made this one.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, you have a particular interest in them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, I particularly notice things like that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you notice anything unusual about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir, it was just a common stretchband identification bracelet.
A lot of them are made of chain links and not stretchbands. Stretchbands are
unusual because there is very few of them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, this was an unusual band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; this one was a stretchband like the one you showed
me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is sort of a hobby with you to make these kinds of
wristbands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; I make watchbands like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recall when you told, talked to the Dallas police officers
that you told them that you had seen a heavy identification bracelet on this
passenger's wrist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir, I told them about the bracelet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told the FBI officers, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; but I don't remember saying it was heavy because I
wouldn't have known how heavy it was without handling it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You described the bracelet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I just described the bracelet as a shiny bracelet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A moment ago you told us about this man getting into your cab
and an old lady coming up and asking for a cab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the man sitting next to you open the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He just started to, sir, just reached for door handle and she
said she wanted me to call one. She didn't want that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the man who was sitting beside you in the cab say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Only that she could have that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that is all.</p>

<p>Any other questions of this witness?</p>

<p>Did you describe the shirt that this man had on to the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. To the best of my ability, I did, sir. I just told them it was a
dark colored shirt with what looked like a silver lining.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you shown the shirt later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. About, it was at least a week later, sir, an FBI man brought
the shirt over and showed it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the same shirt you saw here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I think it is, sir. I am not positive but it had the same kind
of silver streak in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell the FBI man who brought the shirt to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I told him to the best of my ability that was the shirt he had on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the man riding with you say anything at all except tell you
where he wanted to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is all, sir, except he said when we got to where he wanted
to go he said, "This will do fine," when I pulled over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in the police lineup now, and this man was talking to the
police and telling them he wanted a lawyer, and that they were trying to, you
say he said they were trying to, frame him or something of that <span class="locked">sort&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, the way he talked that they were doing him an injustice
by putting him out there dressed different than these other men he was out
there with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did anyone, any policeman, who was there, say anything to
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; Detective Sergeant Leavelle, I believe it was, told
him that they had, would get him his lawyers on the phone, that they didn't
think they were doing him wrong by putting him out there dressed up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did the man you identified have any reaction when
they brought the group out, did he have any reaction that you noticed at the
time you identified him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Only that he was the only one that had the bruise on his head,
sir. The only one who acted surly. In other words, I told this Commission
this morning you wouldn't have had to have known who it was to have picked
him out by the way he acted. But he was the man that I carried in my taxicab.
I told them when I identified him. I didn't identify him as the man who shot
the President. I identified him as the man who rode from the Greyhound to
1500 North Beckley with me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you point him out with your hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; I did not. They asked me which number he was standing
under and he was standing under No. 2.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could he hear you make this identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; he couldn't see me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He couldn't see you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; they had the black silk screen that keeps the prisoners
from seeing the people who show up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know a taxi driver named Darrell Click?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I may know his face, sir, but not his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. We go mostly by numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay, no further questions.</p>

<p>The witness is excused.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May we wait just a moment, please? Would you like
to make a statement, Mr. Powell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think I might say just this: I am here representing
Mr. Walter Craig, as I think the Commission understands. I have been
here the last two days. In a conversation with Mr. Rankin yesterday morning
we agreed that rather than my asking questions directly of witnesses, I would
make suggestions to Mr. Ball or to one of his associates, and I have been following
that practice yesterday and today, after consulting with Mr. Murray who
is also here for Mr. Craig, and Mr. Ball and his associates have followed up
these suggestions that we have made.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The suggestions you have made have been transmitted
to Mr. Ball or his associates and have been asked of the various witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Any other questions?</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Whaley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Thank you, sir. I am glad to be able to be of service.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

PETER PAUL GREGORY</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 9:10 a.m. on Friday, March 13, 1964, at
200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Gerald R.
Ford, member.</p>

<p>Also present were Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel; Norman Redlich,
assistant counsel; and Charles Murray, observer.</p>

<h2 id="kf">TESTIMONY OF MRS. KATHERINE FORD</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford, I would just like to read to you a short statement concerning the
purpose of the meeting.</p>

<p>I think you have had a copy of it but I will just read it for the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mr.
and Mrs. Declan P. Ford and Mr. Peter Paul Gregory. The Commission has
been advised that Mr. and Mrs. Ford made the acquaintance of the Oswalds
shortly after their arrival in the United States in June of 1962, and that Mrs.
Marina Oswald lived in the Ford home on two different occasions in November
1962, and for a period following February 12, 1964.</p>

<p>The Commission has also been advised that Mr. Gregory was contacted by Mr.
Lee Harvey Oswald shortly after Mr. Oswald's return from Russia as a result
of which Mr. and Mrs. Oswald made the acquaintance of a large number of
Russian-speaking people in the Dallas and Fort Worth area.</p>

<p>Since the Commission is inquiring fully into the background and possible
motive of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin, it intends to ask the above
witnesses questions concerning Mr. Oswald, his associations and relations with
others and any and all other matters relating to the assassination.</p>

<p>Would you please rise and be sworn, Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the Commission will be
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be seated. Mr. Liebeler will conduct the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. My maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Katrina Evstratova.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you born, Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Nova Tchkarsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you tell us just briefly how you came to come to the
United States, Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How I came to the United States; I was in Germany during the
war. I was taken there by Germans, not in concentration camps, but in labor
camp, and after we were liberated by Americans I got acquainted with an American
soldier and was married to him, and that is how I came straight to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was this soldier's name that you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Skotnicki.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you were married to him in about 1946?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you subsequently divorced him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Approximately 4 years ago, a little over 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to ask you a few questions about Mr. Skotnicki and
some of the people that he knew.</p>

<p>Do you still have any friends that were your friends when you were married
to Mr. Skotnicki?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I would think, some neighbors, I would say that we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
be still&mdash;we don't see together, acquaintances together with those friends but
I am sure they are still friendly. He is still friendly with the same people as
I am. I would say Campbells down on 6468 Lane, the old house still stands there
I would think he would still be friendly with them, and I know them very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't continue to see Mr. Skotnicki in any way, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, no; I have no reason for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether or not Mr. Skotnicki has a friend by the
name of John M. Grizzaffi? That is spelled G-r-i-z-z-a-f-f-i.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think that he is friends, yes. It is a neighbor across the street.
He was friendly with that man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us just a little bit about Mr. Grizzaffi, if you
know about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think he is in grocery business, that is what I know about him,
and I believe, I wouldn't say he is busy in local politics but he is always talking
about people he knows around town that are in politics, and that is about all I
know. I was never very friendly with his wife and so I just know a little bit
about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Mr. Grizzaffi is a friend of Jack Ruby's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That I don't know. I was told by my son that Mr. Grizzaffi
knew Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your son told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. My young son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is you son's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. My son's name is Gary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is he living with you and Mr. Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He lives with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Mr. Skotnicki knew the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he knew anything about the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Unless something was told by my son or something, by children.
I don't think he knew them personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You yourself didn't have any conversations with Mr. Skotnicki
about the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to go through a list of names which I will go through
fairly quickly and ask you if you recognize any of these names or if you know
any of the people.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about Mr. and Mrs. A.&nbsp;C. Johnson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A.&nbsp;C. Johnson, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of any connection between Mr. Oswald, Lee Harvey
Oswald and Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't know. I don't know that they knew each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell the Commission, Mrs. Ford, how you first met
the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. We were invited there after lunch, the Oswalds had a luncheon
at Anna Meller's house, and we were invited after luncheon to meet them, and
that was our first contact with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me when that was, approximately?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I would say it was approximately at the end of August of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you tell us who was at the luncheon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe there was Mr. and Mrs. Ted Meller and George Bouhe
and the Oswalds and ourselves, I believe that is all I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who first told you about the Oswalds? Did you hear of them
the first time that you came to that luncheon or had you heard of them before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I had heard of them maybe a couple of weeks before from Mr.
George Bouhe, I believe, who had told us that there was a young Russian girl
came to Fort Worth and the man was out of a job, and that was the reason for
us to try to help them. And she had a baby and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Bouhe tell you anything else about the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; he was just telling that the man was having a very hard time
finding a job because the last job he had was in Minsk or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He told you that Mr. Oswald had been in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; he did. He told us about that he was in Russia and decided
to come back and he brought a Russian wife with him who didn't speak English
and had a tiny baby and both were having a very hard time at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Bouhe tell you anything about the circumstances under
which Mr. Oswald went to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; nothing like that was discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the luncheon at which you and your husband, and Mr.
and Mrs. <span class="locked">Meller&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And Mr. Bouhe were <span class="locked">present&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was said at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At the time we were present, actually, I was only interested in
economic conditions of Russia at the moment, for me to compare them with the
time I was living there, and they were showing some pictures of Minsk and
Leningrad and some of the pictures of some of the friends of Marina's friends,
girl friends.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with the Oswalds at that time
about the kind of apartment that they had when they lived in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember any particulars about that apartment, but they
were talking about, I think, about the apartment, I don't know exactly what was
said about it. I know it was, I think I remember they were saying they lived
in one room and sharing a kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you how they came to meet each other in Russia
and how they came to be married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It wasn't said at that particular time, but I remember Marina was
telling me afterwards how they came to meet each other, and I believe it was at
a dance some place at the Hall of Culture or some place they would have in
Russia dances, and she met him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of the people that were at this luncheon, aside from yourself,
how many of them were originally born in Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Bouhe and I believe and Mr. Meller would be&mdash;I believe Ted
Meller was born in Poland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it appear to you at the time of that luncheon that Lee Harvey
Oswald lived like other Russian people lived or did it appear that he might have
received preferential treatment in some way.</p>

<p>Did you gather an impression about that during the course of your conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I believe he was still in something of a hardship in living in
Russia, that was the reason for his leaving Russia. That it was rather difficult
to make his ends meet as we say, because he was comparing it with his living
standards of Marina's uncle who was a colonel or a major, I don't know, I
wouldn't say because I don't know. He was saying that they had a very lovely
apartment consisting of maybe four or five rooms and he was comparing it with
his apartment, and such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he compare his apartment with the apartment of other
workers who worked in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't think so. He was just comparing, I believe with her
uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much money he was paid at his job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember, he was saying or Marina was saying something,
80 rubles, I don't know which one gave me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate whether that was about the same that other
people were paid or more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; about the same as the workers were paid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, is there anything else you can remember about that
luncheon, the conversation at that luncheon which you would like to tell the
Commission about other than what we have already touched on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I don't know what was important. I know he was saying&mdash;my
husband made a sort of a joking statement that he had a child born in
Russia, and he said, well, if it wasn't for the Americans she wouldn't be born
over there because he had to wait so long to get a visa, I don't know what else
he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was a visa for him to return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; and the little girl, June, was born there because of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And Lee Oswald blamed the Americans for causing the delay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate what attitude the Russian authorities took when
he told them he wanted to come back to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't know. He didn't say anything. I don't remember
discussing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say anything about the attitude they took toward letting
Marina leave Russia and coming to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't believe anything was said about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there anything else you can remember about that luncheon
now you think we ought to know about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I am thinking, I really don't think I remember anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the next contact then that you had with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think it must have been at&mdash;in late October or the first part of
November when Mr. Bouhe called me and said that Marina made a call to
Anna Meller and told her she is leaving her husband because of she can't stand
the beating and treatment any longer from Lee Oswald, but none of us knew at
the moment that he had mistreated her that way, but at the time at the party
I remember seeing Marina with bruises on her face and she made excuses of
running into a door or something at the night when attending the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was the first time you saw her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right, the first time I saw her I did see bruises on her
face. And George Bouhe was saying that Anna Meller, I don't know who picked
her up, I believe George Bouhe because Anna Meller don't have a car, they went
to Marina's apartment and picked up the baby things, playpen, and other things
that she could take with her at the time, and she stayed there, I couldn't say
how many days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Stayed with Mrs. Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. With Mrs. Meller, I don't think it was longer than a week, and then
my husband was supposed to go away for a week or so; I don't remember the
time, I thought he was going&mdash;he said he had to go Austin and I told Mr.
Bouhe that I could take her for a week, just take her in, if she didn't have a
place to go, so I did, and she stayed with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why did she come to you as opposed to staying with Anna
Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Anna Meller has a small two-room apartment and I have a bigger
house. We have four bedrooms so I could make room for her and her children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When Mr. Bouhe called you and told you about this, did he
tell you anything about why Marina was leaving Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; he said because of mistreatment and she decided she is not
going to return to him any longer, and Mr. Bouhe said, told her, if she made
a promise to him she is not going to return to that man he will help her all
he could to find a place to stay permanently such as maybe as help at home
at somebody's house until she learns enough English to start going on her
own whatever she could do.</p>

<p>And I think he was trying to do, he was trying to find a place and that
is the reason before that she needed a place to stay until she did find a place,
and I kept her for a week until my husband returned and then another friend
of mine, who also has a fairly large place where Marina could be comfortable,
she told me she could keep her there for as long as Marina wished to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did Marina actually get to your place? Did Mr. Bouhe
bring her to your place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know how long Marina stayed with Anna Meller before
she came to your place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It could be a week but I am not sure. But I don't think it is
longer than a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Lee Oswald come to see Marina while Marina was at your
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; he did not but he did talk to her on the telephone, I think
approximately after 3 days, after she stayed with me he called her up every
night, I think he did call, every evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina talk to him on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She was hesitating at first but he wouldn't leave the telephone
until she came to telephone and she was talking to him. I didn't hear what
he was saying but she was telling him not to call on her again and not to bother,
she was not going to return to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you what the conversations were about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. She did not say anything.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When was this period that she stayed with you, October
and November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe it must have been the first part of November.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did Marina Oswald pay you anything for the privilege
of staying at your home at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I did not expect it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any arrangement she would work in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; there was no arrangement; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us what Marina told you while she was staying there
about her relations with Lee Oswald and particularly as to why she separated
from him and what the difficulties were in their marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think mostly it was a mistreatment by him that she couldn't
stand any longer, she was saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mistreatment by him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mistreatment by him; yes. That is what she was saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you any more specifically than that what the problem
was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she didn't really. She did not elaborate. She did not go into
explanations of their living together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she mention that Lee Oswald was jealous of the Russian
friends that Marina had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she did. She told me that, that he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they argue about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I didn't know if they were arguing about that. I know
she said that he was very jealous of them helping Marina and jealous for the
reason that he wasn't able to provide her at the time with any of the things
that they were giving Marina, clothes, and baby clothes, and I think that he
was&mdash;it was making him rather mad because he said he was unable to buy
the things for her at the time, and I know that he was not accepting things
people were giving him. He was telling her not to take them but she was
taking them because she needed them. I suppose they were arguing about
that but I don't remember the particulars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression at the time that Marina lived with
you for that week as to what the cause of their difficulties might be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She mentioned one time that soon after marriage he told her he
didn't love her any more in any way. So I don't know what is the difficulty,
I don't know if that is what she mentioned. She did not explain and didn't
go into explanations of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think, did you form an opinion as to whether this
separation and the difficulties they were having was primarily the result of
Oswald's behavior or did you think Marina might have been partially responsible
for it, what did you think?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. My own opinion was that Marina was responsible for it. I think
Marina was and I think now she is a rather immature girl.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. She is what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think she is rather immature in thinking.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And a lot of times she agreed herself about provoking him in a
way by arguing about his mother or things of some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she tell you about arguments concerning his mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I don't know really. She would say something that he was
badly brought up or something like that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He was what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Badly brought up, some sort of thing, and he would get mad and
slam her for that or something and then he was telling her not to let mother
in, and when mother comes to the apartment she would let her in and then
they would argue over that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He would tell her not to let the mother in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right, and she would because she said she just couldn't do
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you at that time what her feelings toward
Lee's mother were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember her saying anything one way or the other if
she liked her or didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether Marina might have mentioned that
Lee Oswald had spoken to a neighbor and told the neighbor that Marina was
from Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't know of anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't know at any time that Oswald didn't want people
to know that his wife was from Russia? Marina didn't mention that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not around us, we didn't because we knew it anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina didn't mention anything like that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When Marina lived with you during that time did she tell you
anything about her background in Russia, did she tell you about her birthplace
and youth in Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she was going into more of that in talking with me more
than anything else, I think. Actually most of the time she was talking about
her friends during, I think about when she was going to school, about her
boy friends and things she was talking to me about her friends and she did
go into talk about when she lived in, let's see, it is not Ukraine, I think it is
Bessarabia, right now where would that place be, to live there, and she was
very young, I believe, let's see she was born during the war, and they were
sent somewhere, I don't know where they were sent, but then she lived there in
Bessarabia for a few years, because there was a lot of food there and vegetables
and they were sent there, to feed, like they sent the cattle to be fed up, I
believe that is the expression she used after the war where the children could
eat a lot of fruit and then she returned to Leningrad, I believe.</p>

<p>I don't know how long she lived in Bessarabia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she tell you about her life in Leningrad, just briefly,
if you will summarize it for us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, really, I don't know&mdash;the only thing I knew was about some
of the things she was telling me about friends she had there, she had a friend
that was a medical student and she told me she talked a lot on the telephone
to him, and she was rather, I thought that is where I made the impression to
me, it made an impression to me she was immature, she liked to talk to the
man for a long time in the evening but she was afraid to be seen with him in
the streets, he was ugly, so I thought it was rather strange, you know, and
<span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you who she was living with in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she was living with her stepfather, that is what I remember,
living with a stepfather she was telling me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you about her relations with her stepfather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she did. She didn't like him and I think he doesn't like her,
either; they never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you any reasons why she did not like him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She was telling me a lot of times, she was telling me about her
mother, the mother didn't want to show affection to Marina or something like
that because the father was jealous of that affection, and I think he did some
sort of a cruel thing to her once that she doesn't&mdash;she still remembers as being
very cruel, something of accusing her of taking some family silver and selling it
while she knows that he had pawned the silver for buying liquor, because
it showed up, she couldn't explain it to her aunt and it just made her feel very
bad at that time.</p>

<p>I think she just could never forgive him for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you about her move to Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, she didn't tell me at that time. I just found it out not too
long ago that was the reasons she wanted to get away from a friend that she
found out later that he was married, she went with him for a short while she
did not know he was married, but she did not go into particulars of explaining
the whole thing to me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She was going with a man who was married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes. She met him somewhere, she had two tickets, she said, to
a theater or to a movie, and she wanted to sell one ticket and he was the
person who bought the ticket and they sat together in a movie house and later
on, I believe, I don't know how they got to know each other later on, it was
a few times they met, they have seen each other and at one time she went to
his apartment, to the house that he lived, to call on him, and someone said
that, "oh, that is the man who has that little boy," and she said she just
turned around and went home. That is the time she found out he was married
and was deceiving her.</p>

<p>But I don't know why she left, I mean why, exactly she left but I think this
is the person that was her reason for leaving Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you that she had left in part at least to get away
from this man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is what I understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did Marina tell you why she married Lee Oswald when
she was in Russia, did she talk to you about that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she did.</p>

<p>I don't exactly know why she married him. But she said she met him at a
dance, and soon after that, I don't know the reason why he was in the hospital
but he was in a hospital, and she called on him, and I don't know how long he
stayed there, either, and she liked the man, I think, and she bought him an
Easter Egg, that was during Easter sometime and he was very surprised that
such a thing could be done in Russia.</p>

<p>I think it rather pleased him very well. She said somehow she felt sorry
for the man because none of her friends liked him, and mistrusted him, and
she felt sort of like she was on the defensive, she wanted to, she felt sorry
for him in a way.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she tell you why her friends didn't trust him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she said they were thinking that he was an American spy
or something like that, that is what they were trying to tell her. "Maybe he is
a spy, and how can you trust a man like that?"</p>

<p>She told me the other day, she says no one trusted him, but she says, "I
wasn't afraid of him," that is how she put it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina indicate to you whether she thought or
had any reason to believe that Oswald was a spy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she didn't. She didn't think so. She never said that, I
mean.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina ever indicate to you or did you gather that
one of the reasons that Marina married Lee Oswald was she had the possibility
of leaving the Soviet Union in mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes. She never did go out directly and say that but I think I
got an impression that was her reason. She was telling me that way before
she met Oswald she was dreaming of coming over here, and that is, I mean
gathering by that later I thought that she wanted to come over, and he was,
I suppose he was a reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In this connection, I wanted to ask you whether you ever had
any contact with any newspaper reporters from the Dallas newspapers about
this, did they ask you about this at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. About this I don't remember if they asked me. I don't remember.
But a couple of reporters came to my house soon after the assassination and
talked to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I represent to you that there was a story in the November 27,
1963, issue of the Dallas Times Herald which told about some Russian-born
woman in Dallas to whom Marina had supposedly confided some of the most
intimate secrets of her stormy marriage, in the words of the newspaper article.
Do you have any knowledge whether that would be you or somebody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think that would be me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell the reporters that Marina had told you that
Marina had felt sorry for Oswald because everybody hated him even in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I might have said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina did say that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you anything at this time about their trip
back to the United States and the difficulties that they encountered, or how
they did it, that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I never talked with her about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any conversation while Marina stayed with you
during that week in November 1962, about the possibility of a divorce, of her
divorcing Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The possibility&mdash;I know she didn't want to go back to him at the
time she stayed with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't remember any specific conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't remember any specific conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About divorce?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Frankly, there was talk about it, she didn't want to go back and
I just told her, I felt that Marina wasn't really the domestic type she could
stand very long being a help at home, not that I think she is not capable of
taking care of her own house. I see now since she has got even her own place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
she keeps it very clean and her children are always neat. But she wasn't right
for domestic help and I told her to stay with Lee, that is what I told her myself,
and wait until she could be able to take care of herself other than working in a
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She didn't say, she was really just listening, I think, and she didn't
say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina say anything to you at this time about wanting to
go back to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, no; she didn't want to.</p>

<p>In fact, she told me that Lee soon after he came to the United States, he was
telling her that he would want to go back because he couldn't find a job here
and he was, of course, seeing a lot of difficulties for himself, and Marina said,
"If you want to go back, you can go but I am not going," that is what she told
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina told Lee if he wanted to go back he could but she
wasn't going to go back to Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that all the conversation that you had with her about going
back to Russia at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. That is about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know where the Oswalds lived at this time when
Marina came to the Meller's house and then to your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I have never been at their apartment, and she couldn't tell
me. I know she lived in Oak Cliff, the Dallas section about southwest, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether Marina had lived with a lady in Fort
Worth before they came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I know they stayed there but I didn't talk to her during the
time and I didn't visit her. I know she stayed at Elena Hall's house and I
think Elena had an accident just before that and she was&mdash;she stayed in bed
most of the time. Marina was helping her out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you had only seen Lee Oswald, up to this week that
Marina came to live with you, one time, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the Meller's luncheon party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised on the basis of any judgment you might
have made of Lee Oswald to learn that he had beaten his wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Just from seeing him once I would not have made&mdash;no; that he
has beaten his wife; no, I didn't think at that time. I did, when she came in
after I learned that he has beaten her, I was rather&mdash;I remember the bruises
on her face and that rather made signs to me that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it surprise you that he would have done this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; it did not surprise me. I just felt that young man as he
was, if he was&mdash;decided to go to Russia after living in a country like the United
States, I didn't feel he was very, what shall I say, how would you say, a person's
mind won't work at this <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Unstable?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Unstable, that is how I felt. I felt a person like that, I felt
frankly could do anything.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she ever tell you that Lee Oswald was the cause of
these bruises on her face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, she did tell me after she came to the house to stay with me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is what I mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The bruises you saw on her face at the house she told
you Lee Oswald was the cause?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's clarify that a little. Did Marina Oswald have any bruises
at the time she came to live in your house in November 1962?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; that is right. But she stayed at Anna Meller's house for a
week and when she came to Anna Meller's house I heard there were bruises
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Anna Meller tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Either Anna Meller or George Bouhe told me that. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you yourself did see bruises on her face the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I did see the first time; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you that Lee Oswald had given her those bruises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She told you that when she stayed with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us the circumstances under which Marina left your home
in November of 1962, where she went and what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, she stayed with me a week, and my husband came home
on Saturday, and we discussed with another friend of mine for Marina to go
to her house and stay there as long as she wanted, and I think Sunday morning
this friend of mine, Anna Ray, came with a station wagon and picked all her
things up, her playpen she had for baby, and diapers and things, and took her
to her house and I believe my husband was with her, too, at that time and
that is how she left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, do you know how long she stayed with the Rays?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. With the Rays. I think she just stayed there, she had had dinner
there, I believe she stayed one afternoon. I don't know how soon Lee came
there but he came soon over to the house, but Marina said he cried and begged
her to return, he would be nothing, if she didn't return, he would be finished,
that is what he was telling her, and she said she just couldn't say, no to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So she returned to Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she returned to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever talk with the Mellers about their experiences with
Marina when she lived at their house for that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't remember, she did not discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you remember or did you know where Lee Oswald was
living prior to the time that Marina came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't know where he lived at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know where he was working at that time or if he
was working at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. During the time they lived in Dallas, I believe, I don't know
exactly, though, either George Bouhe or Anna Meller's husband found him a
job in a printing shop, I think, or I believe it is printing shop, somewhere in
Oak Cliff, and that is why they had an apartment there. I remember that is
the reason because George Bouhe was rather mad at Marina for taking an
apartment in Oak Cliff because it was too far for him to drive and help her
when she needed help and the baby, I think he was taking her to the dentist
and taking the baby to a doctor to help her in ways that she couldn't do
herself.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who was doing this driving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe George Bouhe did this. He has the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where does Mr. Bouhe live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He lives, well, I don't know his address now. I know where he
lives but I don't know the street number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it is not in the Oak Cliff Section of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; it is not. I think it would be in the east part of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time that Marina stayed with you, did she say
anything to you about Lee Oswald's political beliefs or his attitudes concerning
politics?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she didn't talk to me about that and I didn't ask her.</p>

<p>Frankly, I didn't talk with Lee about that, I didn't feel the need of it myself
to discuss politics with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss that subject with any of your friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, yes. They were telling me, those friends that went to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
apartment, were telling me, that they have seen books like Karl Marx open
in front of him, just lying there on the table, that he didn't even hide it when
someone came in, and then someone else said there was a book laying there
of How to Be a Spy, laying right open there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe it was Lydia Dymitruk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. D-y-m-i-t-r-u-k.</p>

<p>Do you remember anything about that particular conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, she was telling me, she took, when the baby left my house,
she had a cold, and it was getting worse, and I believe soon after she left
Anna Ray, the baby began to have a fever, and Lydia, I believe, I don't know
how she got to go to her apartment, really, I don't know the reason she went
there; she went there and wanted to take the baby to the doctor and she told
me of an incident that says even Marina was ashamed of Lee because when she
took her to the hospital Lee was lying about that he didn't have a job at the time,
which Lydia knew that he did have. He didn't want to pay for the services,
and people at the hospital was asking him how does he pay for the apartment
and he was telling them that, "My friends were helping me," and Marina just
said something in Russian that Lydia remembers, "What a liar," you know,
behind his back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she say that so he could hear it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think so, because she said it aloud.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And she said it in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In front of Lydia Dymitruk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; that is right, and Lydia was rather mad about the whole
thing and she said she is not going to help them any more if they are acting
that way.</p>

<p>The baby wasn't helped at the hospital. I think the hospital didn't want
to take the child because the father couldn't pay, that is what I got, the father
couldn't pay for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Marina say anything adverse to Oswald in
his presence, did she run him down or make fun of him in public so far as
you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As far as I know, I don't, except the first time, the one time, I
would think when she said, "What a liar," in front of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know of any other instance when she would have
done that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't know of any other instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether she ever spoke of his political views
before other people or make fun of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't remember except lately I have been talking to her
about that and she said she thought of him being young, and she thought she
hoped it would pass with years, that he would mature, this is what she was
telling me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you whether or not she discussed politics with him
herself? Did she argue with him about anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She said she was arguing with him about that. Certainly, in
fact, he called her, she was typical American girl, that she is not interested
at all in politics, except in the material things that he wasn't interested in.
She said she wanted a house and a family and he said, "All the American girls
think that way" and he thought he married a different sort of a girl, a Russian
girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, think back on that week that Marina stayed with you.
Is there anything else that happened or is there anything that Marina told you
that you think we should know about and about which I haven't already asked
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I cannot think of it at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was the next contact that you had with the Oswalds'?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It was right after Christmas before New Year's. I believe it was
the 28th of December, a Friday. I gave, I had, a party for all the friends, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
I invited a family by the name of De Mohrenschildt, wife and husband, and
Mrs. De Mohrenschildt called me up and asked me if she couldn't bring Marina
and her husband over because she was saying it is a shame the way all their
Russian friends have forsaken them during that time and they had no place
to go and the De Mohrenschildts were the only ones helping them at the time,
and I told her I didn't object to it. So she brought them over with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Mr. Bouhe at the party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ray?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were Elena Hall and her husband there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember them being at that party. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were the Mellers there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that De Mohrenschildt was there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there a gentleman by the name of Allen A. Jackson at
the party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And his wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any conversations or observe any conversations
between Marina Oswald and Mr. Jackson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Marina Oswald, no; I don't think so. I don't think Marina spoke
English at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were Mr. and Mrs. Charles Edward Harris at the party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Mr. and Mrs. Harris about the party afterward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I might have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she mention translating a conversation between Mr. Jackson
and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she did not mention it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't see her doing that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I didn't see her doing that at the party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversation with Lee Oswald at the party
that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you notice anybody else talking to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I did. I noticed a girl talking to him who was of Japanese
descent but I don't remember her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anything striking about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I think, the only thing it was that I think he talked to her
most of the time and wasn't making any conversation with anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina comment on that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she didn't. But I heard from somebody else that she did
comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think George Bouhe again. He always spoke to everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did Mr. Bouhe say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, he said something that I asked Marina afterward and she
told me that it wasn't true. He said that Lee talked to that Japanese girl
like a&mdash;it is an expression in Russia to take a bath and then beat themselves
with the leaves from a tree, and the leaf would stick to the body, in the wintertime,
and so the expression from that, like a leaf sticks to the hot body when
you take a bath, you know. Then I suppose Lee struck her as just not saying
anything&mdash;and I asked Marina and she said he did not do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any talk at the party about Oswald's experiences
in Russia or his marriage to Marina?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. During the party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I didn't talk to him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't overhear anybody else talking about Oswald's
experiences in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that the Oswalds came with De Mohrensehildt.
Did they go home with De Mohrensehildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; they did because Mrs. De Mohrensehildt stated that the
lady who stayed with Oswald's child had to leave at 12 o'clock and they left
before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the Oswalds left the party, was there any discussion
about the Oswalds that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; really not. I don't think they made a big impression on
that party on anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you fix the date on which your party was held?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The 28th of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any other party the next day or the day after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There were other parties. I don't think that Marina and her
husband were present. I don't know if you would call it a party, there was
a sort of a get-together at my house afterward because some people stayed over
in town for a few days, I think that was the Rays, and the Harrises, and a friend
of my husband from Louisiana, Sullivans, stayed there. But they hadn't met
Oswald, they came much later after 12 o'clock. So we sort of had a get-together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This would have been the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the 29th of December.</p>

<p>Was Mr. <span class="locked">Bouhe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; Mr. Bouhe wasn't present at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any conversation at that time about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember, 1 don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that there was a party or open house at
Mr. Bouhe's house on the 29th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. If there was, I wasn't present, I didn't go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there a party at Meller's house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was a party or luncheon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I didn't go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear any conversation during this period of 3 or 4
days about Oswald, anybody speculating about Oswald or discussing his
<span class="locked">experiences&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think at that time everyone rather&mdash;George Bouhe said he was
not going to help them any more, he was through, since Marina, he tried to help
her very hard, and she did not hold her word about not going back to him.
So he said since she went back, so now it is her problem.</p>

<p>Well, he is sort of that type of man, he is trying to help hard and if you are
doing what he says otherwise he is not going to help, so that was it. So it was
rather, sort of Marina and her husband were dropped at that time, nobody
actually wanted to help, and I think what they heard about Lydia Dymitruk
was saying that he couldn't help those people. I mean they were just sort of&mdash;he
couldn't reach them. He was lying in hospital and things, we sort of gave
it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Lydia make that remark at one of those parties or was
that at a previous time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Oh, that was a previous time. As soon as she left to go back
to her husband, George Bouhe even took the Russian dictionary back to him.
He told her to give it back and he was just through with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So far as you know Mr. Bouhe had no more contact with the
Oswalds after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversation with any of your friends in
Dallas or Fort Worth on the question of Oswald's ability to leave Russia and
come back to the United States and bring Marina with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. We didn't speculate on that until really later, until now, after
the assassination that subject came up, and people asking why they left so soon.
He was telling me it took them a year, so I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any conversation prior to the assassination, during
this period in 1962, any speculation as to whether Oswald might be an agent
of any government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. I frankly didn't think he was capable of it. That was my
feeling on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were there any conversations on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. There were not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that Mr. Bouhe suggested at one time that
Oswald was a mental case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Bouhe, he might have; yes, I think we all thought that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that Mr. Bouhe said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember particularly that he would say that.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did you say, "We all thought that"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; we thought that, that he was rather mentally&mdash;you just said
the word before.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Unstable?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Unstable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Unstable.</p>

<p>Why did you think that, Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In my own opinion, I just didn't think that a man as young as
he was could come to the conclusions just by rather experiences or living a long
time in America and I mean studying the whole economic structures of different
governments, and things that he would come to the conclusion that is the best
thing for him. I think he was just rather too young for that.</p>

<p>I thought he was just rather&mdash;something was rather wrong with the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You based <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In the conversation that Oswald had with this Japanese
lady at your party, did you overhear any of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I did not. I did not have time, I was the hostess and I just
didn't get to talk to anyone.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever ask the Japanese lady what the gist of the
conversation was or what the content of the conversation was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I never have. In fact, I have not seen her after that. That
was the first time she came to my house. I mean I have seen her later on in
the beauty shop but I have never talked to her about it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she speak English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she speaks English well.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At this get-together that you mentioned at your house on, I
think it was the 29th, after the party, the informal get-together, the Rays were
there, and the Sullivans, and Mr. and Mrs. Harris.</p>

<p>Would it refresh your recollection if I suggested to you that some of the people
that were there at that party said the possibility of Oswald being a Russian
agent was discussed in detail at that party in that group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember any of the discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember any of the discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there anything other than what you told us that led you to
believe that Oswald was unstable or a mental case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Nothing, except that I was thinking about him myself beating his
wife. That would have been one reason. I don't think that any stable man
would do that, especially she appeared to me very sick sort of a woman, not sick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
but frail and fragile, I think any man who strikes a woman who is incapable
of striking back, I would think would be unstable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This Russian group that we have been discussing, Mr. Bouhe
and these other people, do they see each other regularly? Is there sort of a
Russian community in Dallas, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; there are about, I think, maybe four families in Fort Worth
and maybe half a dozen in Dallas or more than that, but that mainly we see each
other, and there is one Eastern Orthodox Church in Russia where that is where
we actually meet each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Dallas, you mean, or Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Dallas. I am sorry. In Dallas, and we still observe our Eastern
Orthodox religion during the holidays and sometimes like Christmas falls 13
days after the American Christmas so there is New Year's sometimes we celebrate
those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How well do you know the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I know George De Mohrenschildt the same, approximately,
I will say I was acquainted with him for approximately 14 years but I don't
know him well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned before that De Mohrenschildt was the only
member of the Russian community that kept on seeing the Oswalds and trying
to help them.</p>

<p>Was there any discussion about that among your friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; George De Mohrenschildt is rather an odd ball, among Russians
anyway, so it was nothing unusual about him doing that. He was always
doing something unusual. He would even go to church with shorts on, you
know, this is something, he would do something that nobody else would do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Shorts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Shorts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Short trousers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any specific conversations about the reasons
as to why De Mohrenschildt continued to associate with the Oswalds after the
rest of you had given them up.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I remember his wife was telling me like she felt it was
their duty now since everybody else dropped them and they needed help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any conversation with the Oswalds among
any of your friends as to whether or not Oswald went hunting in Russia and
had access to weapons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I think that George Bouhe was telling me that. He was
telling him that he was going hunting and he told him about killing ducks or
something of that type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember that in any greater detail?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't remember it. I only remember that because of the
way he was saying, "ducks" in Russian, George was saying that he was using
sort of a word when you call for it, it is a small duck rather than for ducks,
he was saying that his Russian wasn't perfect.</p>

<p>I mean in that conversation he was using, an example of he was saying, when
he would go hunting for ducks, instead of "utki" for ducks he would say
"utitschki" that would mean small ducks, and he was saying that his Russian
was imperfect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is Oswald's Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Marina's ability to speak English at that time, did
she speak English at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't think she did. She could speak a few words but I don't
think she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did any of you attempt to teach her English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; George Bouhe was attempting to teach her to write and was
giving her lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us something about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, he was telling me that he had gotten her a dictionary and
he had&mdash;or some other book anyway and he was telling me that every time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
saw her, made an attempt to see her I don't know how he did that but anyway
he was giving her a lesson and she was supposed to have completed it by the
next time in writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Bouhe tell you anything about Marina's ability to speak
English or write English? Did Marina learn as a result of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He said she was doing very well. I don't know if she learned
to speak but he said she was a good student.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Lee Oswald ever object to this effort on Mr. Bouhe's part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, he was objecting to anyone of the Russians helping her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Helping her learn English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not learning English, but I mean helping her about anything. I
don't know whether he was objecting to that. But we talked with Lee about
this, why he wasn't teaching her English and he wasn't speaking to her and
he said that he didn't want to forget Russian and he really said, "If she
wants," this is what Marina said the other day, that he didn't actually object,
but he thought if she could learn Russian just by herself in any way she could,
she could, but he is not going to help her. He just didn't want to help her by
speaking English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. He is not going to talk English with her, he wanted
Russian. He wanted for the little girl to learn Russian and for himself
not to forget it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate, in other words that he wanted Marina to
speak Russian so that he could maintain his own ability in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he also wanted his children to learn to speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After this party on the 28th of December, what was your next
contact with either Lee or Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. After the 28th? I think after the assassination, I only heard
once about her, I just heard she went to New Orleans. Again a friend, Lydia
Dymitruk, was in the bakery and she said she saw Marina coming in and
she told her she thought Marina was pregnant and she told her Marina was
going to New Orleans. That is the only time I have heard anything about
them after that party. The next contact I had with her was, I don't know the
date but it was soon after the assassination when I just felt sorry for Marina, I
thought she was, I always felt she was innocent, I thought she was a naive
girl in a lot of ways and that is why she got into a lot of problems and troubles.</p>

<p>I just felt if she didn't have anybody there except the FBI and nobody to
speak in Russian, she didn't know how everybody felt, I would think she would
feel very badly, so I called Mrs. Paine who, I found out after the assassination
she was a friend of Marina's and I told her that if she would have a contact
with Marina, tell her that we sympathize with her that she is in the position
that she is, and to call me or to let me&mdash;that I would like to talk with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when it was that you talked
to Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think that was either the first part of December, I think it must
have been at least a week after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In early December?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right after that, I think the next day Marina called me, and
she said the reason she called me was because Mrs. Paine told her that I
called, and let her know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember specifically that Marina told you that she,
Marina, had talked to Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, this, I don't know. I think that is what she did. In
fact, I think that Mrs. Paine told me she talked on the telephone with Marina
but I couldn't be positive about it. I know she wrote letters, they wrote, I
know Mrs. Paine wrote to Marina, and I couldn't exactly say she talked to
her on the telephone or how it was, either Marina called Mrs. Paine or I
don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say you know Marina wrote Mrs. Paine a letter? Did
Marina tell you that she wrote Mrs. Paine during that period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember. I know later Mrs. Paine kept calling me and
asked if I heard from Marina, because she kept writing to Marina and Marina
didn't answer, so she wanted to know if I talked to her, that she was the reason
she was calling me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mrs. Paine indicate to you after she called you trying to
find out from Marina, did she indicate to you she had or had not heard from
Marina since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe she told me she talked on the telephone with her right
soon after, after I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During this first telephone conversation with Marina, was
there anything said about the events of the assassination in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; not at all, except that Marina was very surprised the way
people treated her. She was telling me that if it had happened in Russia,
she just would&mdash;she just knew she wouldn't be talking to me or anybody else.
She knew they would be sent to Siberia or shot right away is what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that what Marina said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is what she said. I told her that was the big difference in
Russian Government and the American Government. And then she asked me
for advice. Someone contacted her at the time from a western paper and
offered her $10,000 or something for the story and she asked me if it was the
right thing to do because she felt she didn't want to make money on such a
thing, a horrible thing as that, and I advised her to take the money because
I thought she would need it for the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after that first&mdash;was there anything else you discussed in
that telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I think we talked mostly about that book deal, about the offer
she had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After that first telephone conversation, what was the next
contact you had with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was quite a long time after that when it was again Mrs.
Paine contacted me, and wanted to know if I could go and translate for them
for, we were saying about that yesterday, what is that union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I did talk to you yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I have forgotten, I couldn't say because it is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it the American Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right, it was the American Civil Liberties Union and I
talked to my husband about that and he tried to find out; I told him to find out
all he can if it had anything to do with a Communist front or something and
if it was I didn't want to do anything about it, to be connected with it, and he
couldn't find anything out, but at the same time I told him that I did not want
to go with them but I didn't mind translating. So I did translate and they
wanted to know if Marina was held incommunicado, and she answered. Mrs.
Paine brought me that letter to translate from English to Russian, and the man
in charge, I don't know his name, I have forgotten his name, you mentioned it
yesterday, if you say it I will remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's come to that in a moment, let's develop the story first.</p>

<p>How did the question of the American Civil Liberties first come up, did Mrs.
Paine bring it up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; that is right, because she tried to write letters to Marina and
she wouldn't answer and she thought she was held in sort of a protective custody
and couldn't see anybody. That is what she felt, and she was rather imprisoned
is what she thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So Mrs. Paine came to you with a letter that was written in
English, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And she asked you to translate into Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that a letter from Mrs. Paine to Marina or a letter from
the Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; from Civil Liberties Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And so you translated that into Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right, I translated it into Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Up to that point was Mrs. Paine the only person who discussed
that subject with you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any further discussions with Mrs. Paine or
anybody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. We tried to find out about the Union and my husband called
lawyers and friends of his who would know about it and called the Secret
Service and FBI and nobody would tell us anything about it. They would
send us somewhere else, refer it to someone else to find out, so we don't find
out.</p>

<p>So, I just decided on my own not to go, just to translate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well now, what is this about going with them, what did Mrs.
Paine ask you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She thought that maybe since I knew Marina she would rather
confide in me more than just anyone like reporters or someone just from
the Union would go there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you declined to go with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when somebody else spoke to you
about this subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, not at all. Just during that time I wanted to find out if she
was in prison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina respond to the letter that you translated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; they received an answer right the next day, and the man
from Richardson, who I think is the head of that Union in Dallas, came to my
house and asked me if I could translate it back into English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that man's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; if you mention it I would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if I mentioned the name
of Gregg Olds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right; yes, that is his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did Mr. Olds say to you when he came to see you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He just brought the letter and he was rather standing and he
wasn't talking very much. He was kind of a quiet person, I think. I took
the letter&mdash;he thought I could just sit there and do it real fast in front of
him, but I had to take it into a room and sort of concentrate in the living room
and translated and giving it to him.</p>

<p>He said, "Thank you," and he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when this was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I cannot say. Let's see. I think it was sometime before
Christmas, because after that I sent her a Christmas card.</p>

<p>No, wait a minute, I just can't say if it was before Christmas or afterward,
I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember if it was before or after Marina testified
before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was before the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was before the Warren Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Marina again on the telephone after this first
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I talked to her on the telephone because through my husband's
brother who is a professor in one of the universities in California, he
had a friend by the name of Isaac Levine who does write, who speaks Russian
and writes rather&mdash;he wrote a book of on the mind of the assassin, Trotsky's
story. He wanted to contact me and to find out if Marina had signed a contract
on writing a book. So I told him that I would call the managers, since there
was published in the newspaper at that time, and to find out if they did, and I
did call. I called her lawyer and I asked if she signed for a book, and I called
Levine long distance and told him she did not have a contract signed. Then he
told me that he would like&mdash;he wanted to know if he could arrange to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Marina, and I told him that I would ask the manager and he told me to contact,
for Levine to contact, the attorney and the manager. I saw later on they have
somehow gotten together. I think he wrote to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when Marina came to your house to visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she brought a letter she wanted me to translate. It was
after this, after I had a contact about the writer Marina called me, this is the
first time, the first time after the assassination that she called me on the telephone
and we talked about that and I told her that the man had contacted me
and he speaks Russian. I thought it would be a good opportunity for her to
write if she wanted to since she could communicate easily with a writer that
speaks Russian. I read his book that he sent me, and he makes real sense. I
invited her to come out to dinner and, of course, I didn't expect that there would
be a whole company with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she come out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; they did, they came out, the Secret Service and the manager
were there and everybody so I cooked a Russian dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It was shortly before the Commission, maybe about 2 weeks before
the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Late in January sometime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During that time that Marina was there did you have any
discussion with her about the events of the assassination or anything relating
to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she discuss with you her possible testimony before this
Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, not during that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina come back to your house again before she came to
testify before the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, she was once more at my house. During the first time her
manager brought a letter that she wanted to bring to the Governor about how
she feels about Ruby's being executed. She told me she didn't want, she didn't
feel, if she could help she didn't want to have the killing of a dead man on her
conscience, on her mind. She wanted me to translate that letter and I did
translate it.</p>

<p>And I left it at home and later on they came by, I told Mr. Martin that I
would come by his house and bring the letter to her after I translated.</p>

<p>He said, "If you wanted to we can come back to your house like we did before."
And they did and they picked up the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any copy of that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think maybe I have a copy of it, of my translation. But I am
not positive. I know I put it in a desk.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was a letter from whom to whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From Marina to, I will say they did&mdash;I think it was advised to her
to write it to the Governor, to Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the present Governor of Texas, that is the Governor of Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said that Marina said to you she did not want to have another
death on her conscience?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. She feels like, she told me she feels strongly about
it, that people shouldn't kill one another, if there is no war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she use the words as you remember it, the words "on her
conscience"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't remember that word really but I just feel this was, she
would feel very badly if that would happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she seem to feel that she had some responsibility for these
things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What do you mean by that? I mean how, responsibility in what
way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That she was in anyway a cause of any of these deaths herself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I wouldn't think she feels this way, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about the conversations at the second meeting. Were
there any conversations at that time about her testimony before the Commission
or about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe she mentioned she was going to Washington at that time.
She knew about going, I believe Martin said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But she didn't talk about her testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she didn't, not at all she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to anybody else about her testimony before the
Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't know, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Martin say anything about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't remember, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was the next time that you saw Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. After she came back from Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she come to your house then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she did not. Her lawyer, in fact Mr. Martin, called me and
told me she is staying at her brother-in-law's, and that he wanted to break the
partnership with her, and he asked me if I could go with her attorney and translate
for her the conditions of the break, the breaking of the contract, and I
agreed to go with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To Robert Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To Robert Oswald's house; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time after that when Marina came to live with
you in your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; when I came there, Marina told me she couldn't stay another
day, she thought, in Robert's house. It was such a small house and small children
and she just didn't like to stay in there at all, and so I told her, "Well, you could
come and stay at my place if you wanted to," and she said she would love to
do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After Marina moved in with you, did you talk to her about her
testimony before the Commission, that she gave before the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; we never talked about what she did. She told me she had it,
written something. She said something maybe that someone mentioned in the
Commission that that was rather good for a novel but not for the testimony.</p>

<p>She said, well, she had written the way she remembers her past, those are the
words she made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She was referring to a statement she had written.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She had written, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she show it to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I have never seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time that Marina stayed with you or at any other
time, did she say anything to you about this incident where Mr. Oswald was allegedly
going to attack Mr. Nixon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I hadn't learned about that until later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss it with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Somehow she didn't feel, she didn't want to discuss it very much,
she felt badly that it came out, I suppose or something. She didn't want it to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But she did talk to you about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She talked to me because I had to translate it to her, the discussion
with her lawyer, and he, I think, the FBI were at the lawyer's office while they
went to talk to her about the subject, and I had to translate what she was telling
the lawyer about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with her about this Nixon affair
at a time when the FBI was not present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think going home, I just maybe, I don't know what I asked her.
She said the same thing actually what she said in the office, that she held him in
the bathroom and I asked her how was it finished, and she said, "I talked him out
of it," and he said, "If you will keep me in the bathroom, just give me something
to read." She didn't talk very much about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask her how she could lock Lee in the bathroom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; it never occurred to me to ask her and I did not ask her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss this question with anybody else how she could
lock anybody in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not until yesterday with my husband, how she could do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there anything else that Marina told you about this Nixon
affair that you can remember now?</p>

<p>Did she tell you when it happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she told me only that, that she said she mixed up dates. She
thought it was one month and it was, supposedly happened, another month and
she said that a lot of times she doesn't remember exactly the month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you anything about the General Walker affair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she told me something about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She said in the first place, people are saying that maybe she knew
ahead of time and she said she did not. Lee told her after it had happened, after
he had shot, and he told her, "Well, I just tried to shoot Walker." She said she
was rather angry and she told him if he ever does that again, she said, "Don't
ever do that again," she was rather disgusted&mdash;that he shouldn't do such a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you about any note that he had written in connection
with the attack on General Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you whether the Walker incident occurred before
or after the Nixon incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't know. She never said it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she discuss with you during this period that she had been
living in your house any of the details of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I, frankly, just didn't feel like asking her questions, I really felt
like I just wanted to help her, that is all. She never brought the subject up
herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she say anything about what happened on Thursday night
when Lee Oswald came back from Irving to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she said that was not long ago, and she somehow found out
someone, I think Robert, told her there was some evidence that someone saw a
boy running across&mdash;a boy saw someone running across the yard or something,
and he thought maybe there was some other man involved. And she began to
say, "Well, if Lee didn't kill the President why did he come home on Thursday
and why did he leave his ring at home and why was the gun taken from the
garage." I mean she was putting that together, she was making me believe
that Lee was doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She was considering at that time the possibility that Lee Oswald
was not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Guilty of this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; Robert, I believe, was telling her that, that there was a possibility
that somebody else did the crime and she was talking about that to me,
and that is when she said about why would he come back on Thursday when
he never did that before, and also that he would leave a ring that was to her it
would mean something that he didn't want&mdash;he didn't feel like he would return
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with Marina her feeling as to Lee Oswald's
guilt or innocence in this matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, she feels that&mdash;no, I don't remember her discussing it. I
think she asked him after she saw him after the assassination he told her no,
he did not kill anybody. He told her that. But I think her own conclusion is
that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussions with her as to whether Lee
Oswald was angry with President Kennedy for any reason?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she told me that he actually never did say anything bad
about Kennedy. He didn't like General Walker because he compared him
rather with Hitler in some way. He said, he was telling her, she was asking
him why would he kill a man like that, I mean that he should not kill anybody.
He said, he told her, well, if somebody killed Hitler ahead of time that wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
have happened in Germany and he says he felt like it was his duty to get rid
of men where he was a Fascist, speaking about General Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina say anything about Lee's attitude toward Governor
Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she never discussed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to Marina about Marina's feelings toward Mrs.
Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Lately, I have been talking to her about that, and Mrs. Paine, I
know, tried to contact her and asked Marina why she did not want to write to
her, because I know that she had written to her often. Somehow she doesn't
like Mrs. Paine and then she said she feels that Martin told her that Mrs. Paine
was making money on her articles about Marina, and she don't like that.</p>

<p>I got, even lately, Mrs. Paine called me up, and I believe it was only a pretense
because she knew that I had a contact with Marina and she wanted to
see Marina. She came to my house and told me she wanted for me to read
in Russian very slowly that she could follow me for her students. She is
teaching Russian to some students in private school and that she could record
it and then listen to it, and she said she would pay me for the services, and at
the time, the same time.</p>

<p>So, I had Marina that evening, I know she would want to see her, so I invited
Marina to my house and at the time Mrs. Paine was coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told her Mrs. Paine was coming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I told her Mrs. Paine was coming and she only said she
didn't want Mrs. Paine for her to know the telephone number or the house she
lives in. She said she would come in all the time and she didn't exactly like
her. She didn't want to see her at her house, not now anyway, she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina and Mrs. Paine meet this evening at your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; they did, they talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did they say to each other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, frankly, I got an idea that Mrs. Paine came there to convince
Marina to write a book with Mr. Levine who is rather persistent about it at
the moment. He wants to start writing a book before Marina finishes with
her lawyer and attorney&mdash;and her manager. She knows and she is advised
by her attorney now not to do it before it is finished, and I think Mrs. Paine
tried to talk her into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They didn't discuss anything about the assassination or Mrs.
Oswald's testimony before the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I did not hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So far as you heard.</p>

<p>Did Marina ever tell you anything about the trip to Mexico that Lee Oswald
took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, let's see. I think she was saying something about it that
she did not mention to the FBI but she mentioned it to the Commission. She
did say that. And that the FBI wanted to talk with her, that was the reason
they wanted to come back again and talk with her. They came to my house
quite often during the time she stayed at my house and talked with her, and
she said that was the subject, and they asked her why she did not say it to
start with, and she said well, she had begun to get tired of the FBI and she
didn't like to talk with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The FBI had been interviewing her while she stayed at your
place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been present at any of those interviews?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; unless they needed&mdash;no; I was not present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were present at an FBI interview at Mr. McKenzie's
office at one time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At Mr. McKenzie's office, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there a translator present when the FBI interviewed
Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; there is at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Gopadze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has Marina discussed with you the questions that the FBI
has been asking her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; except this particular Mexican trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you anything about the details of that trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On that trip&mdash;she did not go into details of the trip; but certain
things about&mdash;she asked Lee to bring her a bracelet and he didn't, things like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she say anything about a desire that Lee Oswald had to
go to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, this is something that she talked about but I don't remember
how&mdash;she said he wanted to actually go to Cuba. He wanted to get a
visa to go to Russia but he would go to Russia by the way of Cuba, and she
thought that he would stay in Cuba and not go to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina tell you what she was supposed to do when
Oswald was in Cuba.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Frankly, I don't know. I know that subject was discussed one
time but I either had to go diaper the baby or something. I just cannot say&mdash;I
know she tried to talk on this subject to Mr. Levine once and she explained
it. It was a rather complicated sort of a thing and I cannot explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she express any fears that Oswald was going to leave her
and go to Cuba and abandon her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was a possibility&mdash;something she would stay here or something,
and for a while, and we were asking her well, how did she intend to live
while he was gone, and she thought, well, she said, well, Lee said, "You have
a lot of Russian friends and they will help you," while he is not here, that was
the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever speak of any plans that Oswald had to hijack
an airplane and go to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she said something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, that was again, I believe she was discussing with Mr.
Levine at the time about this Cuba and this airplane. It is again complicated,
I don't think I can say it to make sense, somehow that he had to go, had to
have enough gasoline or something to go there, not to make a stop anywhere. I
could not say it to make any sense. I know she was talking about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever talk to Robert Oswald about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; we we never discussed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Robert Oswald never expressed to you any thoughts that he
had on Lee Oswald's guilt or innocence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I understand he didn't like the cover of Life magazine and I was
rather surprised because it was in my mind like it seems there is no question.
Nobody knows very sure but I feel like it was Lee that did it. And he was
rather angry about the statement there that it was a gun with which the
President was killed, and he was rather angry about that cover, and that is
why I thought that maybe he didn't believe that Lee killed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is the only discussion you had with Robert Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; that is the only one, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you talked to Marina about any rifle practice that Lee
Oswald may have engaged in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I didn't discuss it with him but she said that she didn't think
that he went to a rifle practice. She told me that about a lot of things that
people would say that it was not true, she thought that she didn't think it
was true about Lee being at practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Grand Prairie you are referring to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Grand Prairie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. She didn't think he was doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she say anything about him practicing with the rifle any
place else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she mention that he had practiced with the rifle at Love
Field?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She didn't say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina ever say anything to you that indicated she wanted
to go back to Russia?</p>

<p>You said before that she told Lee Oswald that if he wanted to go back to
Russia he could go but she wasn't going to go.</p>

<p>But did she ever indicate to you at any time she wanted to go back to
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She did not. Again the first call after the assassination she asked
me, she said, "You know I have a visa, a pending visa, to go to Russia and if
they will send it to me, I may have to go." I sort of answered her, I am pretty
sure they wouldn't send her a visa now so she doesn't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yesterday afternoon we discussed some of these things, did
we not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned the fact that Marina Oswald had told you that
at one time she was thinking about committing suicide?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she mentioned that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She said she didn't want to have it published anywhere, she is
rather ashamed of it. But there was a time after all the&mdash;I think it was before
she went to New Orleans and before she lived at Paine's house, that there was
a time that she didn't have any friends, all the Russian friends left her, I believe
De Mohrenschildts were gone during that time, and that Lee was treating her
rather badly at the time and she just felt like she had no way out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you anything other than that? Did she tell you
she actually tried to commit suicide or was it something she was thinking of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She didn't tell me the particulars but somehow Lee found out what
was on her mind because he had beaten her again and told her only crazy people
would consider doing a thing like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She said Lee had found out she had thought of committing
suicide?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she ever tell you how he found out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she indicate to you in any way that she had ever tried to
do this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, she didn't tell me the particulars of it, I didn't want to, I
mean I just didn't, ask her for all the details about it. But she was saying she
was thinking about doing it at a certain time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, I don't want to press you too hard about it but there is
quite a difference between thinking about doing it and actually doing it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. She didn't hear it, she didn't hear it, did she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right, that is enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you write to Marina at any time after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did I write to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I sent her a Christmas card; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Any other letters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; no letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many times have you been interviewed by the FBI, do you
remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. FBI maybe twice. The first time, soon after the assassination; the
same day that Lee Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Actually we heard by radio, friends of ours had called us, anyone who knew
Lee Oswald was supposed to come out and say it and call the FBI or the police.
So we called the FBI and we said we did know and we came to the office ourselves
and to talk about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been interviewed by the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In our conversation yesterday we discussed your testimony and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
reviewed these matters. Is there anything you can remember that we discussed
at that time that we have not talked about here now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there any other information that you have that you think
the Commission would like to know about that we don't have relating to the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't think there is anything of importance that you don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any papers relating to these matters other than
I think you mentioned a copy of the letter that you translated for the American
Civil Liberties Union, other than that paper, do you have any papers that might
relate to these questions I asked you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I might have a copy of the letter that Marina was writing
<span class="locked">for&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To Governor Connally, and it is just rather a translation in my
own handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On this point about the rifle practice, did Marina tell you simply
that he did not practice at the range at Grand Prairie or he did not practice at
any place with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think she was talking about the particular range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Particularly Grand Prairie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And she didn't say anything about any other practice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She was telling me that people were&mdash;supposedly saw him in San
Antonio and she knew for sure he wasn't there, and then she was saying they
saw him at Grand Prairie practicing and she thought that he wasn't there, and
then again in Ruby's place and she knew sure that Lee would never go to a place
like that, things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford, do you have some questions for Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I have one or two.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Proceed, please.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina Oswald ever tell you about her schooling
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; she did. I think that would be a junior college here. She
would finish 7 or 8 years, I don't know exactly, and then I think it is 4 years in a
junior college which would make her in my opinion an assistant pharmacist.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, she went to the <span class="locked">regular&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. School, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Primary school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Following that she went on to a secondary school.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You don't have to finish primary school. Russian High School
is 10 years, and if you want to specialize in some sort of assistant or technical
work you would finish 7 or 8 years and then you would go 4 years after that, it
is a finishing technical school, whether you would call it, where you would
actually finish high school and at the same time you acquire some sort of a profession
or technician, assistant to engineer or in this case assistant to a pharmacist.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But those were the only schools that she has ever indicated
to you that she attended?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think so, that is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she ever indicate to you the participation that she
had in the Komsomol.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She said that she did join it and then she was kicked out or
something.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she ever give you any reason why she was kicked
out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She told me that one time but I don't&mdash;I have forgotten the
reason, I really don't remember.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it an ordinary thing for a person to be kicked out
of the Komsomol, so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I believe you have to be the sort, if you join it you have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
perform your duty, you have to go the meetings and be sort of a leader in the
community or in school or take on their work so if you don't do that, I think
they just consider you not being a good young Komsomol. They wouldn't keep
you there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina ever tell you that she did or didn't join the
Communist Party in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She couldn't join it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Why couldn't she join it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, not from my own experience but from what I know about
it, I think you have to be over 20 years and you have to be 5 years, you have a
5-year waiting period until they check your background and see if you are good
enough person to get by their standards to join the Party.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina ever discuss with you any schools or training
programs that Lee participated in while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she never has said anything of that sort. I think she said
one time that they wanted to send him to a school which would give him a
profession but it had nothing to do with military or anything like that but
somehow he didn't go there. But I have forgotten what he had to be so he
was just working regular labor in the factory.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You don't recall anything, any details?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't recall any details of the school.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You don't recall any of the details of the kind of school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; but it was some sort of a civilian, it had nothing to do with
military or espionage or anything like that that I remember.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At the time that Marina and June stayed with you and
your husband in October or November of 1962, did Lee Oswald visit her at your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. He did not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He called her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He called on the telephone.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did anyone else visit her while she was staying at your
home on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On this occasion, I think the only person who visited was Anna
Ray to whom she was to go later after she stayed with me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Excuse me, I didn't hear you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Anna Ray, that is another Russian-born person to whom Marina
would go from my house, she came to visit her.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The individual who kept Marina after she left you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right, that is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And his name was what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Her name.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What is the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Anna Ray.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is the only person who visited Marina during this
period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At my house; yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I would like to clarify the time and the circumstances
of this discussion you had with Marina about the Nixon affair.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You had gone to Mr. McKenzie's office with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. I had gone translating for her; yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You were in Mr. McKenzie's office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. With Marina. Who else was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And at that time she had a date with the FBI, and we were
doing, I was translating some legal work for her about dismissing her old attorney
and manager and the FBI called me to come later after we finished with
that, and they told Marina why they wanted to talk with her, and McKenzie
took us in that other office and he asked Marina about that, and told her that
that is what she had to talk about, and she was really angry. She said the
thought Robert had said, I mean she did not tell anybody about it, and she didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
want to talk about it, and now she has to talk about it to the FBI since Robert
mentioned it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In this meeting there was Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. Mr. McKenzie, Marina and I.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Just the three of you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In a room in Mr. McKenzie's office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; in one of the rooms in his office.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And Mr. McKenzie said what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Oh, I think that maybe&mdash;frankly, I don't know what he was telling
her.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this meeting only about the Nixon affair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I am very sorry, but I think that during that time when we were
talking about that it was when he was talking about General Walker, that he
was&mdash;it was not about Nixon that they talked about.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This meeting with Mr. McKenzie, when Marina and you
were discussing <span class="locked">matters&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was about General Walker.</p>

<p>I think Mr. McKenzie didn't know what they would talk about but he advised
her "They will ask you if there were two guns, you tell them there was one gun
that was used," he told her.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. One gun used where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. For Walker, I mean the same one they had at the house or something,
frankly this is what I <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think you just said at the outset of this meeting the
prime purpose or the principal purpose was to discuss the Walker affair.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How did the Nixon affair come up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I just can't recollect how.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did McKenzie raise the question or did Marina raise it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How it was raised, I didn't get to discuss it with her about the
particulars about it, except one time in the car, I don't remember how it came up
and I was asking well how did that happen, and she was rather hesitating to
talk about it, but she said, "Well, I locked him in the bathroom, and he was
screaming or something, he was wanting to get out", and she tried to talk him
out of it and he said, "if you are going to keep me in here just let me have a book
to read", and I told her how did he get out later, she said, "Well, he rather cooled
off and I talked him out of it."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You say this conversation took place in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; this conversation right now took place in the car but I don't
know how it got started, I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say it took place in the car, was it in the car
going from Mr. McKenzie's to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right, to my home. She was staying at my place at this
time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she talk rather freely about this <span class="locked">Nixon&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She didn't talk about it freely, I thought she was rather hesitant
about going into particulars.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she ever indicate why she had not discussed this
incident with anybody, including the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, right during that time, just before that, in the office, Mr.
McKenzie, and I told her before that, "if you know anything that I think that
would help either the Commission or the FBI I thought it my duty to tell them,"
and I told her that if she doesn't want me to say to anybody just don't talk to
me about it, that is what I told her.</p>

<p>But because and maybe that is why she was hesitating to talk to me, Mr.
McKenzie told it to her and had a written statement to her, too, if he feels there
is anything he will have to say he will say it in connection with the President.</p>

<p>So it was said right before that, and I feel maybe that is why she was hesitating
to talk to me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Ford, you are an American citizen now, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. How did you acquire it, by marriage to your first soldier
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. I had to apply for it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Where were you naturalized?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. In the Federal court?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. When was that about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I have it on my bracelet, so I will give you the correct time, I got
it in 1952.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. In 1952?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This I got on "This is Your Life". I was on "This is Your Life".</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have one or two more questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I wish you could clarify, if you can, the comment you
made about Marina mentioning two guns.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She did not mention two guns ever to me or anything like that.
But I don't know how or why he advised her to say that at all, I don't know,
it was not clear to me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say he, was that Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right, because the only reason&mdash;the only thing I remember
about Marina was saying that Lee had laughed about the attempt to kill General
Walker, that he said that they were even too stupid to find out what gun was
used to kill him because it was written up a different type of gun was used
other than the one really used by Lee.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Marina said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. Lee had commented on that they were not even
smart enough to identify the gun by a bullet.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did Marina say Lee said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, soon after he&mdash;maybe that evening or the next day but I
mean after he had attempted to shoot the General.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. After he had attempted to shoot General Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right. And the bullet was found in the room and I suppose
by the bullet they had tried to identify the gun or whatever he used to
shoot him and it was identified wrong.</p>

<p>It was not, I don't know what kind of gun he used, frankly, I don't know, but
he said, he just made a comment, they weren't even smart enough to identify
the gun by the bullet.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Lee said that to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To Marina, that is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right after the incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right after the incident, that is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And Marina told Mr. McKenzie that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But I think right after that it was in the papers that a different
type of gun was used, and to shoot the President was different again, there were
supposedly two guns, you see, so maybe that is why he advised her, that he had
only one gun. I really don't know how this came out.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is all. Thank you very much for coming, you have
been very helpful.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I hope so. I frankly wish I had questioned her more but I didn't
feel it was my duty, but I wanted to tell you what she said to me.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will take a short recess.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Meller and his wife, Anna Meller, George Bouhe, my wife and
myself, Marina and Lee Oswald, and I can't remember for sure if anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
else. It seems to me there was somebody else there but I can't remember who
it was. Someone else may have come in later or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you mention George Bouhe as being there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; George Bouhe was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who invited you to that luncheon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mrs. Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had you heard of the Oswalds prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I first heard of them, I think, from either George Bouhe or maybe
from Max Clark who lives in Fort Worth but I think it was George Bouhe.
He had mentioned the name of Lee Oswald and briefly described his history,
his story of his going to Russia, attempting to give up his American citizenship,
and later returning from Russia with a Russian wife and child, and living in
Fort Worth, and we were, my wife is Russian and we were interested in meeting
her. George Bouhe, I think, at the time was attempting to help Lee Oswald
find employment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say "her" in that sentence you are referring to Mrs.
Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the reason why basically you went to the lunch at the
Mellers to meet Lee and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any conversation with the Oswalds at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was, most of the conversation was in Russian which I don't
understand. I had very little conversation with Lee himself because he spoke
Russian most of the time that afternoon and Marina didn't speak any English
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations in English with Oswald about
living conditions in Russia, about his expenses in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A little bit. He showed me pictures of people that he had worked
with in Russia. I believe they were on a picnic together, a group of men, and
various other pictures of places he had seen in Minsk, and he briefly described
the living conditions in Russia, I guess the conditions under which he had lived
in Russia, the small room they had to live in, and he said something about how
much money he made there. I don't remember how much it was though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what kind of a job he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, he didn't. I think George Bouhe told me he had been a sheet
metal worker or something similar to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In Minsk, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald compare to you the amount of money that he was
paid with the amount of money that other workers in the plant were paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; he said nothing about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate in any way any source of income other than
from his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At any time did he do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever learn of anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I have heard people speak of it but I have never heard him
or anybody that knew him say he had another source of income.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have heard people speak of it when, since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Since the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you heard nothing of it prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get any impressions of Oswald at this first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I had an impression that he was not the type of person I could
make friends with very easily. He didn't impress me as being friendly to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
as a person. He was kind of closed up within himself. And it seemed to me
he preferred to speak in Russian rather than in English. He wanted to practice
speaking Russian with the Russian speaking people rather than talking to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald have any bruises on her at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, she did. On her face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On her face. Was there any conversation about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not directly with me. My wife told me that Mrs. Oswald told her
it was due to some accident of running into a door at nighttime while she was
getting up to see what&mdash;the baby crying, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you accept that explanation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I didn't&mdash;well, really, I didn't accept it. It just didn't make
much sense but it didn't make an impression one way or the other to me. I
frankly at the time thought of a standard cartoon joke of a kid explaining his
black eye, by a kid explaining he ran into a doorknob.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anything that happened at this first luncheon that
impressed you about Oswald or his attitude, in any way that you think the
Commission should know about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Very little. Except he seemed reserved, and I would call excessively
polite, and the fact I don't think he made any effort to make friends with the
other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was the next time that you had any contact with
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The next time I saw him was the night I drove Marina from our
house to another friend's house, Mr. Frank Ray's house. She had been staying
at our house for about a week and she had been separated from him.</p>

<p>I had been out of town and when I came home she was invited to stay over
at Mr. Ray's house and I took her over there, I think it was on a Friday
evening.</p>

<p>Lee Oswald called and wanted to talk to Marina and wanted then to come
out and see her. Mr. Ray told him if he would get on the bus and come to the
bus stop nearest their home that he would pick him up, and I went with Mr.
Ray to pick up Lee Oswald at the bus stop.</p>

<p>We went back to Mr. Ray's home, and had a short conversation with Lee
Oswald but he said he wanted to talk to Marina, and he and Marina went into
another room. I don't know exactly how long it was but we sat down and had
one or two drinks, and then Lee came back in and said he and his wife were
going to have a reconciliation and she wanted to go home with him that evening.
Mr. Ray offered to drive them back to their place in Oak Cliff, and then I went
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were out of town throughout the entire time that Marina
stayed with your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Except for the last night. She stayed there one more night after
I came home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any impression on Oswald that evening different
from the one that you originally had of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Only it confirmed my original thought. I remember one instance.
Frank asked him where he was working and he would never identify the place
he was working. He would hedge, I forget his exact words, but he mentioned
that he was working, I think in a printing shop, either printing or photographic
developing shop, and Mr. Ray asked him the name of the place, I think, twice,
and he avoided answering. He would just start talking about something completely
different.</p>

<p>In other words, when he didn't want to answer a question he would either
change the subject or just start talking to somebody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had no independent knowledge of where he was working at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I didn't know the name. I had heard he was employed in this
shop that I think was a printing and photographic developing shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't have anything to do with his getting that job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether your friend did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I am not sure. I think either George Bouhe or maybe Theo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Meller may have introduced him to the owner of the shop but I am not sure
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with either Mr. Meller or Mr.
Bouhe about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I have had conversations with them, but it was prior to this night
when Lee came to make a reconciliation with his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you that they had anything to do with his getting
this job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't specifically remember that they said so. I either assumed
this or something they said led me to believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with the Rays that evening
while you were taking Marina over there about the difficulties that the Oswalds
had in their marriage?</p>

<p>Let's expand the question. Think about that, and also think about any conversations
that you may have had with your wife about that after you went
back, and tell us the conversations that you had with anybody at that time
about the incidents of the separation, what caused it and what was the trouble
between the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't believe I had any discussion with either Mr. or Mrs. Ray
about specifically the difficulties in their marriage between Marina and Lee
Oswald.</p>

<p>The only thing I remember is frankly saying something to the effect, well, he
is really a screwy nut, or something, he can't find ways to work, something to
that effect.</p>

<p>I have not discussed their personal problems. But I have discussed it with
my wife about it prior to that and after that and also after the assassination
and it was my understanding when she left her husband it was because he had
beat her up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody tell you any of the details about why he had done
that or what the cause of the trouble was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not at the time. My wife didn't tell me anything about that.
Again, after the assassination, she told me more about it, but I don't know if
Marina had mentioned this prior to the assassination, the year before that
when she stayed at our house, or whether she mentioned it after the assassination,
I don't know the exact time that these details were brought out.</p>

<p>My wife did mention that perhaps Marina antagonized him by arguing with
him, talking back to him, or something like that whereas if she just learned
to be quiet when he said something he might not have hit her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't recall whether that was developed during or
at the time or later on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember whether she told me that before the assassination
or not. I know we have talked about it since the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was the next contact that you had with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The next contact was after Christmas 1962. Between Christmas
and New Year's we gave a cocktail party and some friends of ours, George De
Mohrenschildt and his wife were invited and later called my wife and asked
her if it would be all right to bring Lee and Marina to the party and my wife
said sure, bring them along or might have asked me if it was all right to bring
them along and I said sure. It was prior to December 28.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald come with De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, he came with De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know anything about the relations between Oswald
and the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I knew they were friends, no more than that. How often they
saw each other or what they talked about or anything they talked about I
don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How old are the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I guess George De Mohrenschildt is between 50 and 55 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it seem curious to you that a man that age would be close
to Lee Oswald who was around 21 or 22 at that particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not in the particular case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, George De Mohrenschildt has a reputation for being a left-wing
enthusiast or something, I don't mean a member of the Communist Party,
but he is, I have heard other people say he has expounded the ideals of Marxism
and since Lee Oswald was supposedly a Marxist or a Communist they would
agree on their political views.</p>

<p>Again, I have never heard George De Mohrenschildt expound on any of these
ideas. I have met him socially several times and he is very pleasant, a big,
good looking man, but other than their agreement on what is the ideal political
system, I can't think of anything else they would have in common.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your knowledge of De Mohrenschildt's political views are
hearsay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. All of it is hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you learn about Oswald's political views?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Also hearsay, from other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us who told you about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I can't remember anybody, any specific statement from anybody,
but I have discussed it with people like both my wife and George Bouhe and
I don't remember if I discussed it with the Mellers or not but it seems I have
heard this from several different people about just about everybody who knew
them, the Oswalds, this was one of the things that people were leary about
in dealing with him was his reputation for being a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he have that reputation in the community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, I think he had that reputation of either&mdash;not being a member,
say, of the Communist Party, but his political ideas were either Marxist or
Communist or something he had derived from reading Karl Marx, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he expressed any extreme antagonism or
antagonism of any sort toward the Government of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The only occasion I know of was the first time I met him, he did
blame the U.S. Embassy for delaying his exit, the exit of he and his wife from
Russia.</p>

<p>He did state if it had not been for their delaying the exit visa that his
daughter would have been born in the United States rather than Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say anything more about that, do you remember any
more in detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not that I heard of or can remember.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he think the birth of his daughter in Russia rather
than in the United States was something important, did it appear that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't know how important he thought it was. It actually started
as a joke. We also had a baby born shortly before that and I said, "Pretty
little Russian girl" or something like that, and he made a statement, "She is
just as much a Texan as your son," and then went on to explain that if the
U.S. Embassy had acted more quickly that he and Marina could have left
Russia and that June, the daughter, would have been born in the United States.</p>

<p>I don't know whether he placed any great importance on it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever appear to you to have any kind of a sense of
humor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say anything about the attitude the Russian authorities
took when he wanted to come back to the United States and bring his wife
back with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He never said anything to me. I think he may have while he was
talking Russian with these other people. He may have mentioned the fact
that it was easier, they got their visa for he and his wife from the Russian
authorities, the delay came from the American authorities, but I don't specifically
know whether it did. He said these things, again it would be hearsay,
again I would have heard it from my wife or somebody else who could speak
Russian who had either discussed it with him or was present when he was
discussing it with somebody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear Oswald or hear of Oswald making any
remarks that would indicate a hostility toward President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Governor Connally?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Never heard that either, until after the assassination. I saw
newspaper copies of a letter he wrote to Governor Connally when Governor
Connally was Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I would limit my question to before the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Before the assassination, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear anything about his military career prior to
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; in fact I had assumed prior to the assassination that he had had
an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never had any discussions with him about that or heard
anybody discussing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He said something the first time I met him, I can't specifically
remember what it was, but I got the impression that, at that time that he
had been a Marine Corps guard at the U.S. Embassy in Russia and I can't remember
whether he said this or somebody else mentioned it or whether I just
assumed it on my own.</p>

<p>So I know my first idea was this was the way he had gotten to Russia. I
later learned he had gone on his own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't remember any specific discussion with him
about this question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know where Oswald was living during this period
that his wife was separated from him and living with you and Mrs. Meller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I knew he had an apartment in this Oak Cliff section of Dallas.
I don't remember the exact address. I don't know whether he stayed there
while Marina was in our house or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had no knowledge where he lived prior to the time that
he took the apartment in Oak Cliff, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I think he lived in Fort Worth. I am not absolutely sure.
I believe this apartment in Oak Cliff was the first place he lived in Dallas, but
I am not absolutely sure about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had never talked to him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever visit the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, had we gotten to the Christmas party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You asked me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us as best as you can recall the events of that period.
I think you said there was a party at your house on the 28th of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell me if there were parties or get-togethers at which you
were present or of which you knew at other homes during that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, there were, but I don't remember the specific dates that
they were. I think they were after the party at our house. There was a
party at George Bouhe's home, an apartment, during that period. I think it was
a few days after that, right in the period of New Year's Eve, and I went to
several celebrations.</p>

<p>I would hate to try to recall exactly when each one of them was and who
was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember going to George Bouhe's apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; I remember going there but I don't remember the exact date
that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Oswald at that meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any discussion of Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were there any other parties that you attended during that
period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember any formal parties. I stopped and had drinks
with a lot of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Specifically, was there a get-together at your home the night
after the party that you had on the 28th of December?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not a formal party, just a group of people happened to show up
and we started another party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan, friends of ours from New Orleans, and
Mr. and Mrs. Harris who were from Georgetown, Tex., and another Mr. and
Mrs. Ray, not the ones who live in Dallas, but these live in Paris, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would that be Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Thomas Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thomas Ray. And yourself and your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right now I can't remember anybody else who came in. It was
not a formal gathering, just people happened to stop in and we started having
a party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of any discussion of Oswald at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember at any time having any discussion with
any of your Russian friends on the question of whether or not Oswald was a
Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't remember prior to the assassination. There may have
been some but I don't remember any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the party at your home on the 28th of December, did you
have any conversation with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Said "hello, how are you," to he and Marina, and after that, I can't
remember Oswald talking to anybody there except one guest, a Japanese girl,
Yaeko, I forget her last name; my wife will remember.</p>

<p>As nearly as I can remember she was the only person in the whole party that
he ever bothered to talk to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether Oswald was drinking that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I fixed one drink for him, in a little liqueur glass full of liqueur.
As far as I remember he never touched it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever observe Oswald smoking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you don't remember any discussion about Oswald after
he left that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; after he left that evening, I don't recall any discussion of
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any conversations with De Mohrenschildt
about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember any specific conversations with George De
Mohrenschildt. I may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was your impression of Oswald at this time as far as his
relations with the other members of the Russian community were concerned,
and generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. My impression was that he didn't want his wife to associate with
them, and that he resented any aid or help people tried to give either he or his
wife. I might say, I know, I have heard other Russian people there, for example,
would take Marina to a grocery store and buy a load of groceries for
her and take her back, and one girl that went by and found the baby had a
fever and nobody was taking it to the hospital and she took Marina and the
baby to the hospital for some medical treatment for it, and I had the impression
that Lee Oswald resented this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You gained that impression from conversations that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From conversations with other people, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there <span class="locked">any&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I was also going to <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Pardon me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think during the period of 1962 that George Bouhe, for example,
thought it would be helpful for Marina to learn English and he tried to encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
her to learn English and I had heard later that Lee Oswald resented
this, he didn't want her to learn English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you hear that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was back in 1962. I can't remember the specific time, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Harris at
the party at your place on the 28th of December?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Oh, yes; I had conversations with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear of an incident where Mrs. Harris was trying to
teach English to Marina at the party and certain American customs and Oswald
objected to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I didn't observe it. She may have tried to teach her some American
customs. I don't remember hearing Oswald say anything about it, Lee
Oswald say anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mrs. Harris say anything about it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you have no knowledge of that incident if it occurred at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. It seems to me I have heard somebody else mention this but
I did not see it or hear anything myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after the party on the 28th of December that was held at
your house, when was the next contact that you had with either one of the
Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I heard a few times or my wife had heard something about
Marina living in Irving, but never actually saw either one of them until after
the assassination. Then the first contact we had with Marina was, I believe,
my wife tried to get in touch with her, either invite her to come to my house
or to tell her that once things had been cleared up, the investigation had been
cleared up, to feel free to come by, and let her know she still had friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody suggest to you shortly after the assassination that
Marina should come and live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever express any hesitancy to anyone in connection
with any suggestion that Marina should come and live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember ever expressing it. If somebody had mentioned
it the afternoon or next day after the assassination I probably would have
been a little bit hesitant about it. But I don't remember saying anything to
anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when Marina moved into your home
after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; but this was in February of this year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you express any hesitancy at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you don't recall expressing any immediately after the
assassination or before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. I don't remember talking to anybody at all about it. I mean
the first few days immediately after the assassination, I don't recall saying
anything to anybody about it, where she was going to live at my house or
anybody else's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any conversations with Mr. Jim Martin
on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now prior to the time that Marina came to live in your home,
your wife has testified she talked to Marina on the telephone several times and
that Marina came to visit on two or three occasions, two occasions, I believe,
at your home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to your wife about what Marina had said during
your wife's visits with Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When she came to visit us in our home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I talked to her about what she had talked to Marina, and I couldn't
carry on much of a conversation with Marina myself because she didn't speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
much English but I would ask my wife, and my wife would tell me what she
had said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether there was any discussion about
Marina's testimony before this Commission, either before she went to Washington
or after she came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; not&mdash;my wife never told me before she came to Washington
to testify before the Commission. After she came back, I did overhear some
conversation between Marina, my wife, and Mr. William M. McKenzie regarding
the testimony given to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us what that was to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Let me ask you this: Where did this occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think it was in Mr. McKenzie's office, it may have been either
in his office or my home but I think it was in his office, and I believe the FBI
had been questioning her this afternoon, I am not sure of the date, and I came
back later to pick up my wife and Marina and in my presence Mr. McKenzie
asked my wife to ask Marina in Russian if she had told the Commission this
Nixon story. I don't know the details of the story, but something regarding
the threat to Mr. Nixon.</p>

<p>And I think Marina, again through my wife, told Mr. McKenzie that she had
not mentioned this to the Commission. But that she had mentioned it to the
FBI, and she had mentioned it, I believe to the FBI prior to the Commission
hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I was standing there while Mr. McKenzie was talking to
Marina using my wife as a translator.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this in your home, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think it was in Mr. McKenzie's office; it might have been in my
home. Several times I have overheard conversation either in Mr. McKenzie's
office or at my home.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It could have been in either?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It could have been either, but it seems to me it was at his office.
I think as Marina said, she had not said anything to the Commission about
this, and then I think Mr. McKenzie asked her why not, and she said well
she hadn't thought of it or nobody asked her; something to that effect.</p>

<p>I think he was trying to establish whether or not she had purposely withheld
information from the Commission and she said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear Marina Oswald make any remark to the
effect when she was before the Commission she just answered questions and
did not volunteer anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I never heard her say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody ever translate that, a remark like that, so that
you heard it when it was translated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I never heard anybody translate for Marina and say that; no.</p>

<p>In my presence, I never heard her say that and have it translated by anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear from anybody else that she had said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not until yesterday when I was talking about it with you, that
I can remember anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And yesterday when we talked about it, I asked you the question,
had anybody said that, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you obtain any information concerning the Nixon, any
detailed information concerning the Nixon affair as a result of detailed conversations
with your wife after she had had conversations with Marina? I am
assuming Marina would speak in Russian to your wife. Did your wife ever
tell you what Marina had ever said to her about the Nixon affair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A little bit, not all the details. But something to the effect that
Lee Oswald was threatening, I don't know whether to shoot Nixon, and in
some way she had locked him in a bathroom and kept him there, I think all day.
He had calmed down or cooled off and wasn't going to do anything. Just how
she managed to do this, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss the question with your wife as to how?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; not&mdash;again, I never discussed it until yesterday, last night.
I was talking to her and wondered how the devil she managed to lock him
in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you discussed that with your wife last night as a result
of a similar question that I asked you yesterday afternoon when we were
reviewing the testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn anything relating to the Walker affair as a result
of conversations with your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I had read about it in the newspapers; I had read stories
that Lee Oswald had told Marina that he had taken a shot at General Walker
and my wife did tell me later on she asked Marina if this were true and I
think Marina said this was true, that Lee Oswald had told Marina he was
the one who had taken a shot at General Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the extent of your conversations about the Walker
incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; she mentioned something else that my wife told me about.
That after Lee had taken a shot at General Walker, he had hidden the gun
somewhere and went back the next day or a few days later and recovered the
gun. And that Lee was reading the reports in the newspaper and made some
statement, "Well, how stupid can the police be," something to this effect. In
other words, expressing the idea that the police were unable to find out what
happened in the Walker incident. And then also Marina had said at one time,
I believe the day after the shooting of Walker or attempted shooting of Walker,
George De Mohrenschildt had come into the house and made some statement
to them regarding it. I can't remember the exact words but it was referring
to it, Walker, somebody shooting at General Walker, and asking Lee how he
could miss and she was surprised that De Mohrenschildt knew about it and
Marina thought Lee had told George De Mohrenschildt about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever learn how George De Mohrenschildt had learned
about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I imagine he was surprised that Lee had done the shooting
and to him it would have been a good joke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything else about the Walker incident
that you and your wife may have talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; we have discussed it some after, I believe, Marina came to stay
with us, and I expressed the doubt that Lee Oswald was the one who took a
shot at Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any basis for expressing that doubt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The only basis for it was that there was a story in one of the
newspapers that they could not identify the bullet taken out of the wood in
Walker's home as having come from a gun that Lee Oswald owned, it was too
badly destroyed and they couldn't be sure it was the gun, the same gun, that
shot the bullets at President Kennedy and Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So on the basis of that newspaper story you expressed doubts
as to whether Oswald was actually involved in the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I expressed the doubt. It was possible that he really wasn't
the one who took a shot at General Walker but just claimed he did and this to
me would not be surprising.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I think, my opinion of Lee Oswald is that he would do anything
to gain attention for himself, draw attention to himself, make not necessarily
a hero out of himself but just a well-known person. He wanted attention.
He wanted to be a big shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you think in an attempt to do that he might claim he
had been the one who shot at Walker where, in fact, he was not the one at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is possible, I think it is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversations with your wife in which your
wife told you anything that Marina said about the details of the assassination,
about Lee's coming home to Irving and his leaving for Dallas the next morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, we talked about it; I don't recall all the details of what my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
wife told me, whether they were my wife's opinions or things she had heard
directly from Marina.</p>

<p>Apparently Marina was surprised that he would come home in the middle
of the week rather than on weekends or come to visit her, and I gathered that
Marina had thought of these things after the assassination, as she tried to figure
things out. Well this increased her belief that Lee Oswald was the man who
assassinated the President, because he did so many strange things that week,
I mean that day before, not the week, the day before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To your knowledge, has Marina expressed any feeling about
Oswald's guilt while she lived with you or while you were acquainted with
her after the assassination, other than the fact he was guilty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; so far as I know she just accepts the fact he was guilty.
He was the man who shot the President. And she believes this is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss this question with Robert Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, not specifically, I didn't. I never asked Robert Oswald if
he believed that his brother shot the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever indicate to you that he did not believe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not directly. The only thing that might have indicated it was
when Life published a picture of Lee Oswald on the front cover and I read
a newspaper article which stated that Mrs. Marguerite Oswald was intending
to sue Life Magazine and I wondered why, was the picture faked, and Robert
Oswald said no it was a true picture of Lee Oswald but the title of the picture,
that is what he was upset about, and I think the title was Lee Oswald holding
the gun he either used to shoot or used to kill the President, and I didn't pursue
the subject further with him.</p>

<p>I don't know specifically what he was upset about, if he thought his brother
did shoot the President. There was nothing wrong with the statement except
he may not have liked it in print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the only statement Robert Oswald made to you about
the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But he never said he didn't believe his brother did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any other reasons for thinking that Oswald is
the kind of person who would claim to do something that he hadn't done just
to get attention drawn to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, yes; I think he was erratic enough in his behavior throughout
his whole life to indicate that. Of course, I have read a lot about his life since
the assassination, so it is not all opinion I formed prior to the assassination.</p>

<p>It is hard for me to distinguish which things I thought before the assassination
from those I have thought about since the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In that respect let me ask you this question: Were you surprised
when you heard that Oswald had been charged with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think on the basis of your knowledge of him before the
assassination that he would have been capable of such a thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I wouldn't have thought so prior to the assassination and when
I first heard he was picked up, I first thought, well, as I said to my wife, "This
nut has gone down and got himself mixed up just to get some publicity."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You said that to your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; that was my first opinion. When I heard that Lee Oswald
was the man arrested, and I said I think I said, "This idiot has got himself
arrested and got himself mixed up to get some publicity".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What made you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Again, I considered him to be erratic and unpredictable, I don't
know how to explain the things that he would do.</p>

<p>For example, he had gone to Russia and he didn't like it there, he had gone
back to Fort Worth and he didn't like it there. He didn't seem to like any place
that he was, he didn't seem to make lasting friendships with anybody. And he
would hop from one job to another, and move from one town to another. He
never seemed to be satisfied and I considered his whole behavior rather erratic,
and I suppose the main reason was, I felt that he had no desire to support, and
I felt this prior to the assassination, he had no desire to support his wife and
child, and he wanted and would be quite willing to sponge off anybody to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
their support, and this was my primary reason for not wanting to associate with
him rather than any political feelings he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did these things lead you to think that he was not capable
of doing the assassination or that he just went there to get involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Prior to the assassination I never even considered the possibility
of his killing a man but if somebody had asked me prior to the assassination,
I would have answered no, I don't think he would kill anybody. But I don't
think I really even considered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You would <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When the President was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you would have based that response on the things you
mentioned already.</p>

<p>Is there anything else you would have based that reason on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, it is difficult to say. My general opinion of the man was
that he was strange and he did a lot of things I couldn't understand but I had
no reason to think he would attack a person with the intent to kill him.</p>

<p>As far as I knew there was nothing he had ever done before that that would
indicate he would ever kill anybody. I don't know how you tell ahead of time
whether a man can commit murder. I was never worried about him going
out and killing somebody: say I would have never said prior to the assassination
that you have got to watch out for this guy, he is dangerous. He didn't impress
me that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had information prior to the assassination that he had
beaten his wife, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And did you take that information, would you take that, into
consideration in the judgment that you just expressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I don't think so. I think man and wife can fight over a lot of
things and it isn't necessary that either one of them would intend to kill somebody.
He might become violent toward his wife, who is a much smaller and
weaker person but he never impressed me as the type of person who would
violently attack another man, for example.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you first hear that Lee Oswald was held by the
authorities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It was the afternoon of the assassination, I heard on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was your reaction then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Just what I said, my first reaction, "This idiot has gone down to
get himself some attention and confuse the whole issue."</p>

<p>At that time I didn't know he was working in the School Book Depository
Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do subsequent to hearing this radio broadcast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Let's see; I heard it in a hardware store and I went and picked up my
wife who was shopping at the grocery store, picked her up, and told her what
I had heard and we went home. I didn't do anything specifically that I can think
of. I did not mention it to anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you and your wife on the way home from this shopping trip
discuss the apprehension of Lee Oswald and his implication in the affair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, I told her the police had picked him up, and that he was
apparently being held both for the assassination of the President and for shooting
a police officer, and my wife was a little bit worried then, I think, about the
people's reaction to the children, and she said, well, "Don't mention it in front
of the children."</p>

<p>By the time we got home, I believe Linda, my stepdaughter, had already talked
on the phone to Mrs. Anna Ray, who had also heard the radio broadcast and
called up to ask if my wife had heard it, and, of course, by then it was too late,
they knew who Lee Oswald was, they read who he was, that Marina stayed at
our house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then if I understand it you and your wife voluntarily went
down to police headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, the next Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Two days later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; the assassination was on a Friday afternoon. On Sunday morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Mr. Frank Ray called me and said he heard on the radio that the FBI
had requested anybody who knew Lee Oswald to please contact them, and he
asked me what I was going to do, I said, "Well, I don't know, I will call an
attorney and see what he suggests." I called Max Clark at Fort Worth and he
was out, so I called my sister out in Los Angeles. She is an attorney and married
to one, and I said, "Who are you supposed to contact if you know information
about Lee Oswald," and she said she assumed it would be the FBI, so I then
called the FBI office and made an appointment to talk to an agent and we made
the appointment to talk in the FBI office in downtown Dallas. While we were
driving downtown I stopped to get some gas and the attendant told me that
somebody had just shot Lee Oswald and it was right about that time that I went
down to talk with the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In this interval between your first reaction and your going to
the interview with the FBI, did you and your wife discuss any further the
Oswald implications?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I am sure we discussed it, but I can't remember exactly what we
said to each other about it.</p>

<p>I think she was worried at first that her children would suffer some prejudice
from other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina's children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; our children. And, of course, also that Marina was and her
two children, my wife felt, would be sort of considered persona non grata in this
country from then on, but I didn't consider this would happen as long as she
was not implicated in a plot to kill the President.</p>

<p>I know we discussed it but I just can't remember specifically what we said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Ford, did you at any time learn of any desire on Oswald's
part to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes; after the assassination I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, partly from discussing it, I heard it through friends and then
later when Marina talked to my wife, I don't remember if this was during the
time she visited us during January or after she moved in, but she did tell the
story to my wife of his desire, as expressing a desire, to return to Russia, and
I am a little confused as to what the story was.</p>

<p>As nearly as I could make out he had told her he wanted to go back to Russia
first and then later said, no, he was going&mdash;couldn't get a visa to Russia and he
was going to try to get a visa and go through Cuba and then go to Russia, and
then I think he changed his mind again and said he was going to ask for a visa
to Cuba, using it as an excuse with the idea of going to Russia and then stay
in Cuba, and somewhere in there I got the idea that Marina was not willing to
go. He wanted Marina to return to Russia and I had the impression this was
just a&mdash;but I couldn't even give you the details of her various statements which
led me to the conclusions&mdash;as nearly as I could figure out, this was the story she
had told my wife and she told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn at any time through your wife or otherwise that
Marina Oswald at one point had contemplated committing suicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, the first time I heard it was yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During our conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. During our conversations, yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your wife explained to us in our conversations yesterday
that she, Marina Oswald, had told her at onetime contemplated committing
suicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the extent of our conversations yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, sir. That is right. I think my wife said Marina felt so desolate
and downhearted that she felt that was the only way out at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you finished?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any other information or knowledge that you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
the Commission should know about in connection with these matters that we
haven't already asked you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There is nothing I can think of offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In our conversations yesterday you and your wife and I discussed
your testimony today. Have we covered those matters here in the testimony
and have there been any inconsistencies between what we discussed yesterday
and what we have discussed today on the record that you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No; I can't think of any inconsistencies. I assume we have
covered everything we discussed yesterday. I can't remember everything
we discussed yesterday, so I am just assuming we covered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no more questions then.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Have you anything further, Congressman Ford?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Ford, you drove Marina Oswald from your home to
the Ray home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In October or November of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It was in November.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It was November of 1962. How long a drive is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is about 15 minutes. I guess it couldn't be over 7 or 8 miles, 6,
7, 8 miles, something like that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you have any conversation with her at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. She couldn't speak but about a half dozen words of English.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So there was no real conversation between the two
of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, may I confer briefly with counsel?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did you go to the public schools there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I attended both parochial and public schools in Los Angeles and
Glendale.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Then you went to the University of California at Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Right.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Where did you go after that. You were in the service, did
you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I was in the service. After I got out of the service I went back
to UCLA and finished my education and then went to work in the oil industry
first in Bakersfield and in Los Angeles, Ventura, and then went to work for
DeGollyer and McNaughton overseas.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How old are you, Mr. Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Forty-one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Ford, were you at any time present in Mr. McKenzie's
office, William McKenzie, when there was a discussion with Marina Oswald
concerning guns and the gun that was used to or presumably used to attack
Walker and the gun that was subsequently presumably used to attack the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I don't remember any discussion. I have been in his office several
times when he was discussing things with Marina, but I don't remember him
ever asking about this gun or discussing this gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear McKenzie at anytime advise Marina if she were
asked about these guns she should say there was only one gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think I did hear him say that once or something to that effect
but I don't remember specifically the words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you <span class="locked">recall&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But I don't think it was any discussion about the gun used in
shooting General Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As nearly as I can remember it, the whole discussion was, he was
telling her, he had asked her if there was anything else but this one rifle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
she said no, and he said "be sure you always say that there was just this
one gun," but I thought he was referring to the gun used only in the case of
the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He asked her about this before he advised her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Apparently this was after she had been interrogated by the FBI and
I don't know&mdash;I just had the impression they were talking about the possibility
that more than one gun was used in the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the best you can recall about that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The best I can recall, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Ford. I appreciate your coming
here with your wife. You have been very helpful.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Let's call Mr. Gregory.</p>

<h2 id="ppg">TESTIMONY OF PETER PAUL GREGORY</h2>

<p>Mr. Gregory, you were given a copy of a statement of the reason for our
meeting today, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Then I will read it to you. This is <span class="locked">customary&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We read a statement to the witness.</p>

<p>The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Declan
P. Ford, and Mr. Peter Paul Gregory. The Commission has been advised that
Mr. and Mrs. Ford made the acquaintance of the Oswalds shortly after their
arrival in the United States in June of 1962, and that Mrs. Marina Oswald lived
in the Ford home on two different occasions, in November 1962, and for a
period following February 12, 1964.</p>

<p>The Commission has also been advised that Mr. Gregory was contacted by
Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald shortly after Mr. Oswald's return from Russia as a
result of which Mr. and Mrs. Oswald made the acquaintances of a large number
of Russian speaking people in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. Since the Commission
is inquiring fully into the background and possible motive of Lee Harvey
Oswald, the alleged assassin, it intends to ask the above witnesses questions
concerning Mr. Oswald, his associations and relations with others, and any
and all matters relating to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Will you raise your right hand and be sworn, please, Mr.
Gregory.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before this Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be seated.</p>

<p>Mr. Liebeler will ask the questions of you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. My name is Peter Paul Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And will you tell us where you were born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I was born in Chita, Siberia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly how you came to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I came to the United States on or about August 1, 1923. I landed in San
Francisco; came from Japan where I lived for 2 years prior to that. And
my purpose was, of course, to come as an immigrant and to attend the University
of California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you attend the University of California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir; I enrolled at the University in 1923 and I stayed
out of the University for a couple of years but I graduated in 1929 as a
petroleum engineer at Berkeley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What educational background did you have in Russia or
Japan before you came to the United States?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I started my primary education in Russia, in 1912, and my
education was interrupted by civil war in 1919. I finished high school or the
equivalent of high school in Tokyo, Japan, where I attended the American
school in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you learn to speak English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I learned it in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you personally involved in the civil war in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Not personally, no. I was too young; I was only 16, 17 at the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were any of your relatives involved in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. My older brother was an officer in the White Russian Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you presently reside in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir. I have been residing in Fort Worth for the past 20
years, and prior to that in the oilfields in the western part of Texas for 15
years, and prior to that I resided in California from 1923 to 1929.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are presently self-employed in Fort Worth, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I am presently chairman of the Yates Pool Engineering Committee
which is a group of engineers supervising activities in the Yates oilfield
in Pecos County, Tex., and I am also a consulting petroleum engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you are fluent in the Russian language, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I am, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In fact, you teach Russian at the Fort Worth Public Library,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, I do; as a civic enterprise. I teach Russian once a
week from 10 to 20 weeks a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately how long have you been doing that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. For about 3 or 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us about your first contact with Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of June 1962. On that particular morning, I was in
the office, my telephone rang, and the voice on the other end told me that my
name was given to him by the Fort Worth Public Library. He knew I was
teaching Russian at the library, that he was looking for a job as a translator
or interpreter in the Russian and English languages, and that he would like
for me to give him a letter testifying to that effect.</p>

<p>He spoke to me in English, so I suggested to him, not knowing who that
was, that he might drop by my office and I would be glad to give him a test.
He did. He came by the office, about 11 o'clock that morning, and I gave him a
short test by simply opening a book at random and asking him to read a
paragraph or two and then translate it.</p>

<p>He did it very well. So I gave him a letter addressed to whom it may concern
that in my opinion he was capable of being an interpreter or a translator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened after you gave Mr. Oswald&mdash;this individual was
Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir; that individual was Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>After that, I asked him&mdash;I noticed that he spoke with what I thought to
be a Polish accent, so I asked him if he were of Polish origin, and he stated
that he was not, that he was raised in Fort Worth, Tex., but that he learned
Russian in the Soviet Union where he lived for 2½ or 3 years.</p>

<p>He also told me that he married a Russian girl, and that he brought his
wife with him, and that they also had a baby. I told him that I knew of no
openings at the time&mdash;I didn't know of any&mdash;for services of a translator or
interpreter, but that if he would leave his address I would be glad to get in touch
with him if and when I learned of any such openings.</p>

<p>He gave me his address. He lived with his brother at that time at the
western edge of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever send him any work as a translator or interpreter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you and Mr. Oswald have lunch together that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir. It was about noontime when I gave him that test, so
I invited him to lunch, and during the lunch being naturally curious about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
present day life in the Soviet Union, I was asking him questions, asked how
people lived there, and so forth.</p>

<p>He told me that he was employed in a factory in Minsk as a sheet-metal worker.
He told me a little bit about the working conditions and living conditions in
that country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how he was paid as a worker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I think I asked him what he was paid and my recollection
is that he told me he was getting about 80 rubles a month. I may be wrong
about that but that is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he compare his salary with the salary of other workers in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Other workers in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, he did not. By way of comparison. I was curious as to
what the purchasing power of his earnings would be, I asked him what 80
rubles would buy, and I think he mentioned, as I say, a pair of shoes cost
around 15 rubles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you that he had any source of income other
than his job at the factory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you anything about why he went to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The only statement he made that I remember, he said, "I went
to the Soviet Union on my own," but I did not feel like prying into his affairs. I
did not press the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you notice anything about the way he was dressed or anything
else about him that would seem strange to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; it was a very hot morning. You know in Texas in the
middle of June, it is generally hot. I remember that he wore a flannel, woolen
coat, suit, and atrocious looking shoes that were made in Russia.</p>

<p>I know he was very uncomfortable because he was too warmly dressed for
that time of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Oswald tell you anything else at that time about conditions
in the Soviet Union or his attempt to come back to the United States or
bringing his wife back that you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I don't recall of anything outstanding that he told me. But I
think he did tell me that they, he and his wife, left Moscow by train, and they
went through East Germany to Berlin, I believe, and that their destination was
Amsterdam, I believe, where they took a ship to come to New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he express anything about any difficulties that he might
have had in returning to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it seem extraordinary to you that his wife was able to
leave the Soviet Union with him or didn't you think about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I thought at the time it was more than extraordinary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Because simply from reading accounts of the difficulties experienced
by so many Americans who married Russian girls in the Soviet Union,
and all the difficulties they had to secure permits from the Soviet Government
for an exit visa for their wives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss that with Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was the next time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The next time was a few days later, and the occasion was this,
to the best of my recollection. My youngest son Paul, who at the time was a
junior at the University of Oklahoma, Paul majoring in economics and also
studying the Russian and the German languages, Paul expressed a wish to
meet Marina Oswald simply because she was fresh from the country, Russia;
that presumably her language was pure Russian language as compared to mine
which became, shall we say, affected by my 40 years living in the United States,
is not pure Russian any more probably, in fact, he thought that maybe he
could take lessons of the Russian language from Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>So, I arranged; I called Lee Oswald at his brother's residence, and asked if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
it would be, if they would be, at home, that my son and I would come out to
visit them, and we did. I don't remember the date but it must have been within
possibly within 10 days, the first 10 days after his initial contact with me at
the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let us try to set the date of your initial contact. I have here
a copy, not a confirmed copy, but just a typewritten copy of a letter entitled "To
Whom it May Concern." I show it to you and ask you if that is the letter to
the best of your recollection that you gave to Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think that is a copy of the letter I gave. That was on June 19,
1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I ask that it be admitted in evidence and marked as the next
exhibit.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be marked.</p>

<p>It will be marked as Exhibit 384.</p>

<p>Very well, it is admitted as Exhibit 384.</p>

<p>(The letter referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 384 for identification
and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I would hazard a guess that the second contact with Lee Oswald
that I just referred to was made, say, around the 25th, toward the end of June
1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you went to see him at his brother's house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. At his brother Robert's, Robert Oswald's house. Paul and I
spent there perhaps an hour, speaking Russian with Marina, and mostly with
Marina. They showed some pictures, snapshots of their friends, of themselves,
taken in Minsk. We talked about the living conditions, just in a very general
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss politics with Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; we did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss politics with him at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Not with Lee Oswald, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get the impression from just talking to the Oswalds
at this time that Oswald was treated pretty much as other Russians were in
Russia or did you think he had a special situation there in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. My personal impression was that he was treated there as the
rest of the Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your son subsequently have additional contacts with the
Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. He and I made arrangements for Marina Oswald to give
him lessons, conversational lessons, I believe it was twice a week, and Paul
paid her for these lessons. I don't remember the exact amount, whether it
came under the minimum or not, it was around a dollar and a half an hour.
And he took those lessons after he made a visit to his aunt in San Francisco
in July of 1962. So, I would say that he took lessons from Marina Oswald, say,
from approximately August 1 to September 15 when he went back to the university
of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember when the last contact was that your son
had with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. To the best of my knowledge his last contact with them was
the Thanksgiving Day of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your son tell you whether he had discussions with Oswald
concerning politics and economics and things like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He mentioned once, I believe, that there were political discussions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He told me that he thought Lee Oswald was pretty silly in
his views.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Pretty silly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Silly.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Silly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he express any <span class="locked">other&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He also mentioned that he saw some book on Marxism, whether
it was Das Kapital or some other book I don't recall now, but he saw a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
on Marxism in Lee's residence when they lived on Mercedes Street in Fort
Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say in words or substance that he thought that Oswald
was a half-baked Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think that is the expression he used, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did there&mdash;did you ever go to Oswald's own apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, I went there once to take Paul to his lesson. I, in other
words I visited in their so-called living room once, when they lived on Mercedes
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In Fort Worth, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us what the conditions in their home were like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It was practically a bare room. There was no furniture to
speak of. There was the bare necessities; there was no playpen or crib for the
baby. The baby was playing in the middle of the floor in the living room, as I
remember. It was an extremely primitively furnished room, and the rest of
the house was the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any impression as to whether the Oswald baby
was being adequately cared for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; that I don't know. I do know this, that Oswald showed
outward signs of love toward the baby. He would pucker his lips and this
and that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Indicating that he had affection for the child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. For the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At that visit did you have any discussion with Oswald about
living conditions or anything else in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; I simply took Paul in for that lesson, and I left before
the lesson began.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did there come a time when you held a dinner party to
which you invited Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. Well, really, it was not a dinner party. It was a small
dinner. I mentioned the fact that Marina Oswald went to school in Leningrad,
formerly St. Petersburg prior to the revolution, and a friend of mine, George
Bouhe of Dallas, who is an accountant, was born and raised in St. Petersburg.
He indicated to me that he would like to meet Marina Oswald and his fellow
townswoman and townsman, so I discussed it with my wife, and she thought
she will invite Marina Oswald and Lee Oswald and Mr. Bouhe, and a friend
of Mr. Bouhe, Mrs. Meller of Dallas, to their dinner. I am sure Paul was at
home at that time, so there were six of us at the dinner and my wife and my
son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you tell us when the dinner was held?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; it was before Paul went back to school so I assume it was
in the early party of September, maybe it was late in August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Bouhe is a native born Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; he was born in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Mrs. Meller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I assume Mrs. Meller was born in Ukrania.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During this dinner party was there any discussion between
Mrs. Meller and Mr. Bouhe with the Oswalds concerning their background,
experiences in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The conversation, as I recall it, centered mostly on St. Petersburg.
Bouhe brought with him his albums of St. Petersburg, and he was
asking her and they were both looking at the pictures, and is such and such
statue on the main street of St. Petersburg, and so on and so forth. I think
that was the gist of the conversation.</p>

<p>They also discussed the present day life in the Soviet Union. I do recall, the
conversation was mostly with Marina, and she did not speak any English at
that time, so all of that conversation was in the Russian language, which my
wife does not understand at all.</p>

<p>I remembered that Lee Oswald hazarded, he would interject into the conversation,
and he was a little bit critical of the attitude of the Soviet Government
toward its own people, and here is what I am trying to say; he said they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
make the best shoes in Minsk for export, and the people get the&mdash;and I think he
indicated his own shoes, which he still wore at that time. Then just very, very
slight criticism, not politically, but sort of in the sense of economics that the
people were not getting the best products, they were all for export.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, at that time was there any indication that Oswald
was better treated than other people in the Soviet Union or did you maintain
the impression throughout your acquaintance with Oswald that he was treated
similarly to other Russians?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That was my impression, that he was treated the same as other
Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you detect any friction between Marina Oswald and Lee
Oswald at this dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any indication at that time that Lee Oswald had
beaten his wife in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Not at that time; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see any indication that Marina Oswald had been
beaten?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; I haven't seen it personally. I have heard reports from
my friends that he did mistreat her physically, and that he had blackened her
eyes, and once even extinguished a cigarette on her shoulder, something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. To the best of my recollection it was either&mdash;I think it was
Bouhe or it could have been Mrs. Meller, but I believe it was Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was at a time subsequent to this dinner party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir; subsequent. It was after the assassination of the
President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That Bouhe told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald at all discuss the reason why he went to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he just told me, you know once, the very first time I met
him that he went there on his own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate any desire to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I learned subsequently that he did but he never indicated it
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald maintained contacts with people
that he had associated with in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. None to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know that he wrote them letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir. Excuse me, sir, when you asked me about his relations
with Marina Oswald, I don't know whether this is of any importance or not,
but during my first visit at their apartment on Mercedes Street in Fort Worth,
the second time I saw Marina, I suggested to him that he should insist that
she learn English as quickly as possible because it would be so much easier
for her to get along in this country, and he replied that he would prefer that
she did not learn English at all or else he would lose his fluency in the Russian
language.</p>

<p>So it showed to me that he didn't particularly care about her. He cared more
about himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you say anything to him in response to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; I was frankly very much disgusted with that sort of
attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever come to your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, he came to my office once or twice more. Once I was in
the office when he came, and at that time, apparently he was downtown, my
office is downtown in Fort Worth, he brought with him some typewritten
sheets which he told me he was writing his memoirs of his life in the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p>I remember seeing, I did not read the manuscripts at all, but I saw some
snapshots or photographs attached to some typewritten sheets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During this time that you&mdash;did you have any other contacts
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, he came to the office once more but I was not in the
office, my secretary told me that he came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what he came to your office for? Did he
indicate any particular reason for coming there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I don't recall. I don't know why he came back. Frankly, I
don't remember. Here is something else that&mdash;one of the newspaper reporters
came to the office and asked me if I would deliver a letter to Oswald, a reporter
who tried several times to contact Oswald and get the story of his life or something
like that, and they simply refused to see him. Why he choose me, I don't
know. How he learned that Oswald came to my office, I don't know. But this
man came and asked me to deliver this letter to Oswald the next time he came
to the office, and I remember now that he did come once or twice more because I
handed him that letter, and Oswald took it and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When were these visits, the second and third visits to
your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I would say that was probably during the month of July 1962.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever ask you to help him work on a book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That he was working on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than these contacts we have discussed, did you have
any other contacts with Oswald ever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, I was at home when my son Paul answered a telephone
call from Lee Oswald and he asked if Paul would come to get them, I guess
they were at his brother's, they were going to Dallas, they moved to Dallas by
then, so it must have been in October or maybe it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it Thanksgiving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It could have been Thanksgiving. It was Thanksgiving. It
was Thanksgiving Day. Paul went to Oswald, Robert Oswald, and brought
Marina and Lee Oswald and the baby to the house. He fixed some sandwiches
for them and he took them to the bus station and they went to Dallas where
they had already established residence. That was the last time I saw Lee
Oswald and Marina Oswald until after the assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the basis of your contacts with Lee Oswald during this
period of time, did you form any judgment of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir; I think I did. He impressed me as a man that, first,
he carried some sort of a chip on his shoulder. I also had the impression that,
probably unfounded on my part, I don't know, I just formed that impression,
that he, Lee Oswald, felt that he did not get proper recognition from the people,
say, in the United States, maybe even in the Soviet Union. I don't know. In
other words, I felt like he thought that he was a better man than the other
people thought he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have the feeling that he desired to achieve recognition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That is my distinct impression of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any opinion as to whether he was ever able to
command this recognition and respect that he was seeking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think he was an intelligent person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Fairly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think he was capable of performing an act such as an
assassination of a President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What do you base that opinion on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, he was a Marine; he, as I said, he carried a chip on his
shoulder. From the best&mdash;from what I have read and so forth, I personally
am of the opinion that he assassinated the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well now, based on your knowledge of him prior to the assassination
did you have any reason to believe that he might do such a thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Prior to that time, no, sir. I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't regard him as a dangerous individual or something
of that sort, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, I thought he was&mdash;I did not think he was an unbalanced
person or crazy person or anything like that. I would say he was sort of, I
would say I thought he was sort of a peculiar person but I never thought he
would do an act like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever make the acquaintance of the mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, I teach Russian once a week at
the library. We started a new series of lessons on November 12, 1963, and in
my class there was a lady by the name of Marguerite Oswald. Frankly, I never
connected her with Lee Oswald. Oswald was just a name to me, and I did
not learn about it until the day of the assassination. Or the next day, the
next day, that she was his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald call you on the telephone at any time after
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. She called <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Sunday morning, November 24, about 7 o'clock in the morning,
from Dallas.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is the mother called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The mother. Sunday morning about 7 o'clock in the morning,
and she said, I still remember, she said, "Mr. Gregory, I need your help. The
reporters, the news media were badgering me." I think that is the word she
used. She said, "I wonder if some of your friends or you could provide a
place for me to hide from them." And it sounded like she was crying on the
telephone, although I think that woman is not taken to crying.</p>

<p>So I told her&mdash;she did not want to identify herself when she called me first.
I asked her, I said, "Who are you?" And she said, "I would rather not tell you
who I am but I shall identify myself by saying I am one of the students in
the Russian class in the library." Of course, I knew it was Mrs. Oswald. In
fact, I guessed who she was before she even tried to identify herself. So I told
her, I said, "Now, I will tell you what I will do, Mrs. Oswald, you stay where
you are and I will promise to you that I will come to see you sometime today."
Of course, I knew where she was because the Secret Service told me where
they had her before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Secret Service contacted you the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Isn't it a fact they had asked you to come and translate an
interview with Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't do it because you didn't need to do it that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, I did not see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you later on Sunday go to see Mrs. Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. As soon as I hung up the phone, I was talking to Marguerite
Oswald, I called the U.S. Secret Service and reported this call, of
course, and an agent, I called Agent Howard, who lives just north of Fort
Worth, and he said, "Well, that is fine, we will find a hiding place for her, for
Marguerite and Marina Oswald and the babies," and he suggested he come by
my house in a matter of 45 minutes or an hour and we will go to Dallas and
then proceed from there. And that is what we did then. We went to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You went to the Executive Inn where Marina and Mrs. Oswald
were staying at that time, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir; we went to the Executive Inn, and on the way we
stopped en route on the turnpike, where the agents arranged a rendezvous with
Robert Oswald and other agents, and we went to the Executive Inn in Dallas
by the airport, and Robert and I went in and we told the women to pack up, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
we were going to take them to, Robert told them we were going to take them to,
the farm of his wife's parents, north of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But Mrs. Oswald objected to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, she objected, she said she didn't want to go there. But I
told her that she bothered me to come, to call me at the house to provide a
place for her and here I am, and if she doesn't like it then I am just through
with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told her that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. So she packed up and we got with the agents in two or three
cars, two cars, and we started toward that farm of Robert Oswald's parents.
But en route we detoured because Marguerite Oswald mentioned the fact that
the two little babies were all wet, and that there were no diaper change for
them, that Marina and she had no change of dresses, and so forth, and she insisted
that we go by Irving where Marina lived with Ruth Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then you went and obtained some materials for the babies
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, we didn't go to the house because we got the report that
Lee Oswald was shot. You see, that all happened Sunday morning, it was 11
o'clock in the morning, we were driving from Dallas to Irving and we got this
report that Lee was shot, and the police advised us not to go to the house
because there was a mob, so we went to the Chief of Police of Irving, to his
residence. Marina telephoned Ruth Paine from there to gather these things for
the babies and a change of dress for her and some money and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You went from there, then, to Parkland Hospital where some
events occurred and then you came back to the Inn of the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to ask you about something that might have happened
or happened at the Inn of the Six Flags.</p>

<p>There has been a newspaper report, and Mrs. Marguerite Oswald has said
that on Saturday night an FBI agent came to the Executive Inn and showed her
a picture of a man who she claims to be Jack Ruby. Have you seen newspaper
reports to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, I have seen reports to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, Mrs. Oswald says, also, that while at the Inn of the Six
Flags she observed a newspaper that had Jack Ruby's picture in it and exclaimed
in the presence of other people that that was the same picture as the FBI had
showed her, that is what she says. Did you ever hear her say anything like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She never did anything like that in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you met Mrs. Oswald, Marguerite Oswald, and had a
chance to observe her, did that further your judgment of Lee Harvey Oswald
in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir. I felt that a lot of his, many of his, peculiarities,
possibly were brought on by the influence of his mother.</p>

<p>To me, she impressed me as being not necessarily rational. She is quite
clever, but she certainly is most peculiar. She demands public attention, she
wants to be the center of attention. As, for example, standing there in the
middle of the room at the motel of that Six Flags, standing in the middle of
the room saying "I want to make a statement," and she made those statements
throughout the frequent intervals and always she would precede the statement
by saying, "I want to make a statement. I feel that my son can't be
buried anywhere but at the Arlington National Cemetery."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you detected similarities between Mrs. Oswald and Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I felt they both craved public recognition or to be craving
attention or publicity or whatever you wish to call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In our conversation last evening about your testimony, I
asked you about Mrs. Ruth Paine, and you told me that Mrs. Ruth Paine had
come to visit you at a time subsequent to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir; she never did. Ruth Paine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. She called me on the phone once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Called on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. But I have never met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the conversation between you and her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. She asked me if I would tutor her in writing letters in Russian.
If I remember, she mentioned that she either was going to write to the Soviet
Embassy or Soviet Union, something like that, but I told her I was just too
busy, I have no time for that. In fact, I didn't want to have anything to do
with that sort of&mdash;I didn't want to write letters to the Soviet Union or to the
Embassy or anybody else.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How long have you taught Russian, Mr. Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In the library?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. For approximately 3 or 4 years from 10 to 20 weeks a year.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you taught Russian in any other area or capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir; I taught Russian a couple of years ago, not more than
2 years ago, at Carswell Air Force Base at Fort Worth, where I had a class of
officers and men in the Russian language. With the result that two out of my
class passed the Russian examination, and the rest flunked.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How long would you estimate it would normally take
for a person of average intelligence to learn to speak and write Russian as
fluently as Oswald did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. If he lived in this country or in that country? That would
make a lot of difference.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, let's take this country first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. This country. That would depend again on the effort put out by
the particular individual. If he were in earnest I would think he could do it
in about 4 years.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is an ordinary person living in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Living in the United States.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who <span class="locked">made&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Going to study Russian, say at the university, normal load,
maybe 4 hours a week, plus homework, it would take about 4 years.</p>

<p>If he lived in the <span class="locked">country&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In the Soviet Union, he probably could do it in 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Oswald tell you when he first visited you that he
had learned to speak Russian, where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He never gave you any indication he had learned or
studied prior to going to the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have about one or two more questions.</p>

<p>Did you discuss at any time with Marina Oswald the conversation that she
had with Lee Oswald after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Would you mind to state that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Marina Oswald spoke with Lee after the assassination, when he was in the
jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, I don't remember whether it was Marina or whether it
was Marguerite Oswald. I don't remember now; they did go to see him in the
jail in the city of Dallas, and it must have been Marguerite because she was
bragging what a wonderful son he is because he looked at the little girl, June,
she is 2 years old, and he said, "You have got to buy her a new pair of shoes,"
I remember that. It must have been Marguerite because she used that as an
illustration of what a wonderful boy he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than that, you have no information as to what transpired
at that time, happened at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it be fair to say, Mr. Gregory, that it was through
Oswald's contact with you that he subsequently made the association with and
contact with the other members of the Russian community in Dallas and Fort
Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think that would be a fair statement, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no more questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I have one more, Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>I believe Marina has testified when she first met Lee Harvey Oswald it was
approximately 17 months after he had arrived in the Soviet Union. She testified,
also, that she could not tell whether he was a native born resident of the
Soviet Union or a foreigner by the way he spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is that unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, frankly. I don't know. You see, Congressman, the city
of Minsk is what we call, they call it, not we call, they call it in the White Russia
Republic. You know they called this the Union of Republics, you know, in
the White Russian Republic, and Minsk, I guess, is the capital of it.</p>

<p>It is fairly close to Poland, and there are all sorts of people, Poles, Lithuanians,
probably Latvians, that lived in that part of the country, and none of those
people speak pure Russian.</p>

<p>Now, whether she had reference, whether that had anything to do with her
<span class="locked">statement&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Her observations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Right; I don't know.</p>

<p>Now, I thought that Lee Oswald spoke with a Polish accent, that is why I
asked him if he was of Polish descent.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But <span class="locked">leaving&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. But, otherwise, I would say it would be rather unusual, rather
unusual for a person who lived in the Soviet Union for 17 months that he would
speak so well that a native Russian would not be sure whether he was born
in that country or not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That would be a very unusual kind of a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It would be, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Or a person who had unusual training?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Right, or unusual ability or training, yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Gregory. You have been very
helpful.</p>

<h2 id="jjh">TESTIMONY OF COMDR. JAMES J. HUMES</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Commander Humes, will you please step up. You know, Commander, what
we have met for today to take your testimony concerning the autopsy and
anything else you might know concerning the assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Would you raise your right hand, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission will
be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Will you be seated?</p>

<p>You may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. James Joseph Humes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your profession or occupation, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I am a physician and employed by the Medical Department
of the United States Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your rank in the Navy?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Commander, Medical Corps. United States Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you receive your education, Commander Humes,
please.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I had my undergraduate training at St. Joseph's College
at Villanova University in Philadelphia. I received my medical degree in 1948
from the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I received my internship and my postgraduate training in my special field of
interest in Pathology in various Naval hospitals, and at the Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology at Walter Reed in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do your current duties involve?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. My current title is Director of Laboratories of the Naval
Medical School at Naval Medical Center at Bethesda. I am charged with the
responsibility of the overall supervision of all of the laboratory operations in
the Naval medical center, two broad areas, one in the field of anatomic pathology
which comprises examining surgical specimens and postmortem examinations
and then the rather large field of clinical pathology which takes in examination
of the blood and various body fluids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been certified by the American Board of Pathology?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; both in anatomic pathology and in clinical
pathology in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What specific experience have you had, if any, with respect to
gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. My type of practice, which fortunately has been in
peacetime endeavor to a great extent, has been more extensive in the field of
natural disease than violence. However, on several occasions in various places
where I have been employed, I have had to deal with violent death, accidents,
suicides, and so forth. Also I have had training at the Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology, I have completed a course in forensic pathology there as part of
my training in the overall field of pathology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to participate in the autopsy of the late
John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your specific function in connection with that autopsy?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. As the senior pathologist assigned to the Naval Medical
Center, I was called to the Center by my superiors and informed that the President's
body would be brought to our laboratories for an examination, and I
was charged with the responsibility of conducting and supervising this examination;
told to also call upon anyone whom I wished as an assistant in this
matter, that I deemed necessary to be present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who did assist you, if anyone, in the course of the autopsy?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. My first assistant was Commander J. Thornton Boswell,
whose position is Chief of Pathology at the Naval Medical School, and my other
assistant was Lt. Col. Pierre Finck, who is in the wound ballistics section of
the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
When I ascertained the nature of the President's wounds, having had the
facilities of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology offered to me by General
Blumberg, the commanding officer of that institution, I felt it advisable and
would be of help to me to have the services of an expert in the field of wound
ballistics and for that reason I requested Colonel Finck to appear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell us who else in a general way was present at the time the
autopsy was conducted in addition to you three doctors, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This, I must preface by saying it will be somewhat incomplete.
My particular interest was on the examination of the President and
not of the security measures of the other people who were present.</p>

<p>However, the Surgeon General of the Navy was present at one time or another.
Admiral Galloway, the Commanding Officer of the National Naval
Medical Center; my own commanding officer, Captain John H. Stover of the
Naval Medical School, Dr. John Ebersole, one of the radiologists assigned
to the Naval Hospital, Bethesda, who assisted with X-ray examinations which
were made. These are the chief names, sir; that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did the autopsy start approximately?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The president's body was received at 25 minutes before
8, and the autopsy began at approximately 8 p.m. on that evening. You
must include the fact that certain X-rays and other examinations were made
before the actual beginning of the routine type autopsy examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Precisely what X-rays or photographs were taken before the
dissection started?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Some of these X-rays were taken before and some during
the examination, which also maintains for the photographs, which were
made as the need became apparent to make such.</p>

<p>However, before the postmortem examination was begun, anterior, posterior
and lateral X-rays of the head, and of the torso were made, and identification
type photographs, I recall having been made of the full face of the late President.
A photograph showing the massive head wound with the large defect
that was associated with it. To my recollection all of these were made before
the proceedings began.</p>

<p>Several others, approximately 15 to 20 in number, were made in total before
we finished the proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now were those X-rays or photographs or both when you
referred to the total number?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. By the number I would say they are in number 15 to
20. There probably was ten or 12 X-ray films exposed in addition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did this autopsy end?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. At approximately 11 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What wounds did you observe on the late President, if any?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The wounds which we observed on the President were&mdash;excuse
me, at this point might I use the charts which I have prepared?</p>

<p>Would that be appropriate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; would you like to start with the neck wound?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>I might preface my remarks by stating that the President's body was received
in our morgue in a closed casket. We opened the casket, Dr. Boswell
and I, and the President's body was unclothed in the casket, was wrapped in
a sheet labeled by the Parkland Hospital, but he was unclothed once the sheet
was removed from his body so we do not have at that time any clothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, before you identify what that represents let me
place Commission Exhibit No. 385 on it so it may be identified.</p>

<p>(The drawing was marked Commission Exhibit No. 385 for identification.)</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. When appraised of the necessity for our appearance
before this Commission, we did not know whether or not the photographs which
we had made would be available to the Commission. So to assist in making
our testimony more understandable to the Commission members, we decided
to have made drawings, schematic drawings, of the situation as we saw it,
as we recorded it and as we recall it. These drawings were made under my
supervision and that of Dr. Boswell by Mr. Rydberg, whose initials are H. A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
He is a hospital corpsman, second class, and a medical illustrator in our command
at Naval Medical School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you provide him with the basic information from which
these drawings were made?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Distances, that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. We had made certain physical measurements
of the wounds, and of their position on the body of the late President, and we
provided these and supervised directly Mr. Rydberg in making these drawings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you checked the drawings subsequent to their preparation
to verify their accuracy?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And proportion?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I must state these drawings are in part schematic.
The artist had but a brief period of some 2 days to prepare these. He had
no photographs from which to work, and had to work under our description,
verbal description, of what we had observed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would it be helpful to the artist, in redefining the drawings
if that should become necessary, to have available to him the photographs or
X-rays of the President?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. If it were necessary to have them absolutely true to
scale. I think it would be virtually impossible for him to do this without the
photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the reason for the necessity for having the
photographs?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I think that it is most difficult to transmit into physical
measurements the&mdash;by word the&mdash;exact situation as it was seen to the naked
eye. The photographs were&mdash;there is no problem of scale there because the
wounds, if they are changed in size or changed in size and proportion to the
structures of the body and so forth, when we attempt to give a description of
these findings, it is the bony prominences, I cannot, which we used as points of
references, I cannot, transmit completely to the illustrator where they were
situated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is the taking of photographs and X-rays routine or is this
something out of the ordinary?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir; this is quite routine in cases of this sort of
violent death in our training. In the field of forensic pathology we have found
that the photographs and X-rays are of most value, the X-rays particularly in
finding missiles which have a way of going in different directions sometimes, and
particularly as documentary evidence these are considered invaluable in the field
of forensic pathology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you now proceed to show us what Commission Exhibit 385
depicts, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Actually, I think, sir, at this time the view from the
posterior aspect would also be of value to the Commission.</p>

<p>This <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor, I hand you the second exhibit which is marked Commission
Exhibit No. 386.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 386 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe at this point I would like to have, if you have
my gross autopsy description because I will give the dimensions of these wounds
at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We will use the Commission Exhibit No. 387 and I will ask you
first of all, for the record, to identify what this document is, Dr. Humes.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 387 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This document is a copy of the gross autopsy report
which was prepared by myself, Dr. Boswell, and Dr. Finck, and completed within
approximately 48 hours after the assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does that report bear your signature at its end?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It bears my signature on the first or covering page as well
as on my last page, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you now proceed to tell us what you observed with respect
to the wound which is marked as appearing in the upper back or lower neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you identified that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The one on the side is 385 and the one of the rear view is 386.
And that one is 387. For purposes of our record, if you will, put them in as 385
and 386 for our printed record. You might want to put them in chalk above them
so you will see the one on the left is 385 and on the right is 386.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. These exhibits again are schematic representations of
what we observed at the time of examining the body of the late President.</p>

<p>Exhibit 385 shows in the low neck an oval wound which&mdash;excuse me, I wish to
get the measurements correct. This wound was situated just above the upper
border of the scapula, and measured 7 by 4 millimeters, with its long axis roughly
parallel to the long axis of vertical column.</p>

<p>We saw&mdash;I would rather not discuss the situation of the anterior neck at this
time or would you prefer it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How would you prefer to do it, Dr. Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I would prefer to discuss the wounds, two wounds, we
saw posteriorly and the wound, other wound, of the skull before going to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is fine, Dr. Humes, do it any way you find convenient. I
will give you the other drawing and you can do them both together. Let the
third drawing be marked as Commission Exhibit No. 388.</p>

<p>(The drawing referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 388 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The wound in the low neck of which I had previously
begun to speak is now posteriorly&mdash;is now depicted in 385, in 386 and in 388.</p>

<p>The second wound was found in the right posterior portion of the scalp. This
wound was situated approximately 2.5 centimeters to the right, and slightly above
the external occipital protuberance which is a bony prominence situated in the
posterior portion of everyone's skull. This wound was then 2½ centimeters to
the right and slightly above that point.</p>

<p>The third obvious wound at the time of the examination was a huge defect over
the right side of the skull. This defect involved both the scalp and the underlying
skull, and from the brain substance was protruding.</p>

<p>This wound measured approximately 13 centimeters in greatest diameter. It
was difficult to measure accurately because radiating at various points from the
large defect were multiple crisscrossing fractures of the skull which extended in
several directions.</p>

<p>I have noted in my report that a detailed description of the lines of these
fractures and of the types of fragments that were thus made were very difficult
of verbal description, and it was precisely for this reason that the photographs
were made so one might appreciate more clearly how much damage had been
done to the skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the photographs made available then, Dr. Humes, when
Exhibit 388 was prepared?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The photographs, to go back a moment, the photographs
and the X-rays were exposed in the morgue of the Naval Medical Center on this
night, and they were not developed, neither the X-rays or the photographs.
They were submitted to the, and here, if I make a mistake I am not certain, to
either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or to the Secret Service, I am not sure
of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you submit those yourself immediately after they were
taken, Dr. Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Again, one of the senior people present, I believe my own
Commanding Officer, Captain Stover, took care of turning this material over to
these authorities, and receiving a receipt for this information, for this material.
It was&mdash;I supervised the positioning of the body for various of these examinations
but as far as beyond that, I did not consider that my responsibility.</p>

<p>These, then, were the three wounds which were quite obvious at the time of
the examination.</p>

<p>I could expand further on the general appearances of these wounds or I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
turn to the anterior portion of the body and describe various other wounds
which were present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were focusing on 388 before I last asked a question, Dr.
Humes. Why don't you describe in general terms the nature of the wound
which was present at the top of the head of the late President?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. With your permission, sir, and Mr. Chief Justice, I
think I might describe those two wounds together, and describe the defects in
the scalp and in the skull in each instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be fine.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Would that be appropriate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Turning now to Commission Exhibit 388, where we have
depicted in the posterior right portion of the skull a wound which we have
labeled "in" or a wound of entrance and a large roughly 13 cm. diameter defect
in the right lateral vertex of the skull. I would go into some further detail in
describing these wounds.</p>

<p>The scalp, I mentioned previously, there was a defect in the scalp and some
scalp tissue was not available. However, the scalp was intact completely past
this defect. In other words, this wound in the right posterior region was in
a portion of scalp which had remained intact.</p>

<p>So, we could see that it was the measurement which I gave before, I believe
15 by 6 millimeters.</p>

<p>When one reflected the scalp away from the skull in this region, there was a
corresponding defect through both tables of the skull in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe what you mean by both tables, Dr. Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The skull is composed of two layers of bone. We will put the scalp in in
dotted lines.</p>

<p>The two solid lines will represent the two layers of the skull bone, and in
between these two layers is loose somewhat irregular bone.</p>

<p>When we reflected the scalp, there was a through and through defect corresponding
with the wound in the scalp.</p>

<p>This wound had to us the characteristics of a wound of entrance for the
following reason: The defect in the outer table was oval in outline, quite similar
to the defect in the skin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are referring there, Doctor, to the wound on the lower part
of the neck?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir; I am speaking here of the wound in the occiput.</p>

<p>The wound on the inner table, however, was larger and had what in the field
of wound ballistics is described as a shelving or a coning effect. To make an
analogy to which the members of the Commission are probably most familiar,
when a missile strikes a pane of glass, a typical example, a B-B fired by a child's
air rifle, when this strikes a pane of glass there will be a small, usually round
to oval defect on the side of the glass from whence the missile came and a
belled-out or coned-out surface on the opposite side of the glass from whence the
missile came.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Experience has shown and my associates and Colonel
Finck, in particular, whose special field of interest is wound ballistics can give
additional testimony about this scientifically observed fact.</p>

<p>This wound then had the characteristics of wound of entrance from this direction
through the two tables of the skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "this direction," will you specify that direction
in relationship to the skull?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. At that point I mean only from without the skull to
within.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine, proceed.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Having ascertained to our satisfaction and incidentally
photographs illustrating this phenomenon from both the external surface of the
skull and from the internal surface were prepared, we concluded that the large
defect to the upper right side of the skull, in fact, would represent a wound of
exit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
A careful examination of the margins of the large bone defect at that point,
however, failed to disclose a portion of the skull bearing again a wound of&mdash;a
point of impact on the skull of this fragment of the missile, remembering, of
course, that this area was devoid of any scalp or skull at this present time.
We did not have the bone.</p>

<p>In further evaluating this head wound, I will refer back to the X-rays which
we had previously prepared. These had disclosed to us multiple minute fragments
of radio opaque material traversing a line from the wound in the occiput to
just above the right eye, with a rather sizable fragment visible by X-ray just
above the right eye. These tiny fragments that were seen dispersed through the
substance of the brain in between were, in fact, just that extremely minute, less
than 1 mm. in size for the most part.</p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, this would be a good juncture to produce two
photographs.</p>

<p>May it please the Commission, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I have identified as
Commission Exhibits 389 and 390 which will at a later time be identified as being
two frames from the motion picture camera operated by one Abraham Zapruder,
being the amateur photographer who was on the scene, which I think would assist
in evaluating the angle of the President's head corresponding to that exhibit
designated as 388.</p>

<p>I will hand those to you, Dr. Humes, and ask you if you would state for the
record the relative position of the President's head in 389 which is a frame about
one-sixteenth of a second before the point of impact shown in Exhibit 390.</p>

<p>(The frames referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 389 and 390
for identification.)</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It will be noted in Exhibit 389 that the President's head
is bent considerably forward and perhaps somewhat to the left in this frame of
the photograph 389.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that in approximately the same position as the angle of the
head depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 388?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, at this time I would like to move for admission
in evidence of Exhibits 385 through 390.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted under those numbers.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibits Nos. 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, and 390, previously marked
for identification, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you proceed now, Dr. Humes, to continue in your description
of the head wound?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Head wound&mdash;a careful inspection of this large defect in
the scalp and skull was made seeking for fragments of missile before any actual
detection was begun. The brain was greatly lacerated and torn, and in this area
of the large defect we did not encounter any of these minute particles.</p>

<p>I might say at this time that the X-ray pictures which were made would have
a tendency to magnify these minute fragments somewhat in size and we were
not too surprised in not being able to find the tiny fragments depicted in the
X-ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how many fragments were observed, Dr. Humes,
on the X-ray?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I would have to refer to them again, but I would say
between 30 or 40 tiny dust-like particle fragments of radio opaque material, with
the exception of this one I previously mentioned which was seen to be above
and very slightly behind the right orbit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were these all fragments that were injected into the skull by the
bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Our interpretation is, sir, that the missile struck the
right occipital region, penetrated through the two tables of the skull, making
the characteristic coning on the inner table which I have previously referred to.
That one portion of the missile and judging by the size of the defect thus produced,
the major portion of the missile, made its exit through this large defect.</p>

<p>A second portion of the missile or multiple second portions were deflected, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
traversed a distance as enumerated by this interrupted line, with the major portion
of that fragment coming to lodge in the position indicated.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of these minor fragments were dislodged from the major one as
it traversed this course.</p>

<p>To better examine the situation with regard to the skull, at this time, Dr.
Boswell and I extended the lacerations of the scalp which were at the margins
of this wound, down in the direction of both of the President's ears. At that
point, we had even a better appreciation of the extensive damage which had
been done to the skull by this injury.</p>

<p>We had to do virtually no work with a saw to remove these portions of the
skull, they came apart in our hands very easily, and we attempted to further
examine the brain, and seek specifically this fragment which was the one we
felt to be of a size which would permit us to recover it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you refer to this fragment, and you are pointing there,
are you referring to the fragment depicted right above the President's right eye?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; above and somewhat behind the President's
eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you proceed, then, to tell us what you did then?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. We dissected carefully in this region and
in fact located this small fragment, which was in a defect in the brain tissue
in just precisely this location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How large was that fragment, Dr. Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I refer to my notes for the measurements of that
fragment.</p>

<p>I find in going back to my report, sir, that we found, in fact, two small fragments
in this approximate location. The larger of these measured 7 by 2 mm.,
the smaller 3 by 1 mm.</p>

<p>To make my presentation of this wound of the skull more logical to the Commission,
I would like to go forward in time that evening to at a later hour.
I apologize&mdash;time and what happened exactly at what moment escapes me at
this time.</p>

<p>I mentioned previously that there was a large bony defect. Some time later
on that evening or very early the next morning while we were all still engaged
in continuing our examination, I was presented with three portions of bone
which had been brought to Washington from Dallas by the agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>These <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Might that have been by a Secret Service agent?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It could be, sir; these <span class="locked">things&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At any rate, someone presented these three pieces of bone to you?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Someone presented these three pieces of bone to me,
I do not recall specifically their statement as to where they had been recovered.</p>

<p>It seems to me they felt it had been recovered either in the street or in the
automobile, I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>We were most interested in these fragments of bone, and found that the
three pieces could be roughly put together to account for a portion of this defect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much remained unaccounted for, Dr. Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I would estimate that approximately one-quarter of that
defect was unaccounted for by adding these three fragments together and seeing
what was left.</p>

<p>This is somewhat difficult, because as back to when we were actually looking
for the fragments of metal, as we moved the scalp about, fragments of various
sizes would fall to the table, and so forth, so it was difficult to put that exact
figure into words.</p>

<p>However, the thing which we considered of importance about these three fragments
of bone was that at the margins of one of them which was roughly pyramidal
in shape, there was a portion of the circumference of what we interpreted
as a missile wound. We thus interpreted it this because there was, the size
was, sufficiently large for us, for it to have the curve of the skull still evident.
At the point of this defect, and I will draw both tables of the bone in this
defect, at the area which we interpreted as the margin of a missile wound,
there was a shelving of the margin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
This would, to us, mean that a missile had made this wound from within the
skull to the exterior. To confirm that this was a missile wound, X-rays were
made of that fragment of bone, which showed radio-opaque material consistent
and similar in character to the particles seen within the skull to be deposited
in the margins of this defect, in this portion of the bone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then what conclusion did you reach as to what caused that
hole reconstructed from the three portions of the late President's scalp?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. We reached the conclusion a missile entered the left&mdash;the
right posterior inferior <span class="locked">portion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor, perhaps it would be helpful if you would refer to that
as letter "A" and the exit as letter "B", so that the record is clear on those two
points and perhaps it will be helpful to your description as well.</p>

<p>And would you mark them as well, with a pencil?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is not entry for the second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Exit for the second?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I will label 388 with the letter "A" to indicate our opinion
as to the wound of entrance into the skull.</p>

<p>I will label as Point "B" the area of exit of a portion of the missile that
entered posteriorly. I say a portion because a small fragment was seen in the
position previously noted which was recovered.</p>

<p>However, we concluded that a very significant portion, perhaps the largest
portion, made its exit and accounted for this very large defect for the multiple
fractures of the skull and for the loss of brain and scalp tissue at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe at this juncture the damage which was
inflicted upon the brain, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. May I refer at this point to the gross description of
the brain prepared separately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Certainly, Dr. Humes, if you prefer to do it in that order.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe you have that. It is the second portion of
the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir. I can make that available to you here.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. While that is being provided, when we reflected the scalp
away from the badly damaged skull, and removed some of these loosened
portions of skull bone, we were able to see this large defect in the right cerebral
hemisphere. It corresponded roughly in size with the greatest diameter of the
defect in the scalp measuring some 13 cm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record now show I am handing to you, Dr. Humes,
an exhibit marked Commission Exhibit 391, and will you identify what that
is, please, Doctor?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Exhibit 391 is listed as a supplementary report on the
autopsy of the late President Kennedy, and was prepared some days after the
examination.</p>

<p>This delay necessitated by, primarily, our desire to have the brain better
fixed with formaldehyde before we proceeded further with the examination of
the brain which is a standard means of approach to study of the brain.</p>

<p>The brain in its fresh state does not lend itself well to examination.</p>

<p>From my notes of the examination, at the time of the post-mortem examination,
we noted that clearly visible in the large skull defect and exuding from
it was lacerated brain tissue which, on close inspection proved to represent
the major portion of the right cerebral hemisphere.</p>

<p>We also noted at this point that the flocculus cerebri was extensively lacerated
and that the superior sagittal sinus which is a venous blood containing channel
in the top of the meninges was also lacerated.</p>

<p>To continue to answer your question with regard to the damage of the brain,
following the formal infixation, Dr. Boswell, Dr. Finck and I convened to examine
the brain in this state.</p>

<p>We also prepared photographs of the brain from several aspects to depict
the extent of these injuries.</p>

<p>We found that the right cerebral hemisphere was markedly disrupted. There
was a longitudinal laceration of the right hemisphere which was parasagittal
in position. By the saggital plane, as you may know, is a plane in the midline
which would divide the brain into right and left halves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
This laceration was parasagittal. It was situated approximately 2.5 cm.
to the right of the midline, and extended from the tip of occipital lobe,
which is the posterior portion of the brain, to the tip of the frontal lobe which
is the most anterior portion of the brain, and it extended from the top down to
the substance of the brain a distance of approximately 5 or 6 cm.</p>

<p>The base of the laceration was situated approximately 4.5 cm. below the
vertex in the white matter. By the vertex we mean&mdash;the highest point on
the skull is referred to as the vertex.</p>

<p>The area in which the greatest loss of brain substance was particularly in
the parietal lobe, which is the major portion of the right cerebral hemisphere.</p>

<p>The margins of this laceration at all points were jagged and irregular, with
additional lacerations extending in varying directions and for varying distances
from the main laceration.</p>

<p>In addition, there was a laceration of the corpus callosum which is a body
of fibers which connects the two hemispheres of the brain to each other, which
extended from the posterior to the anterior portion of this structure, that is
the corpus callosum. Exposed in this laceration were portions of the ventricular
system in which the spinal fluid normally is disposed within the brain.</p>

<p>When viewed from above the left cerebral hemisphere was intact. There was
engorgement of blood vessels in the meninges covering the brain. We note that
the gyri and sulci, which are the convolutions of the brain over the left hemisphere
were of normal size and distribution.</p>

<p>Those on the right were too fragmented and distorted for satisfactory description.</p>

<p>When the brain was turned over and viewed from its basular or inferior
aspect, there was found a longitudinal laceration of the mid-brain through
the floor of the third ventricle, just behind the optic chiasma and the mammillary
bodies.</p>

<p>This laceration partially communicates with an oblique 1.5 cm. tear through
the left cerebral peduncle. This is a portion of the brain which connects the
higher centers of the brain with the spinal cord which is more concerned with
reflex actions.</p>

<p>There were irregular superficial lacerations over the basular or inferior aspects
of the left temporal and frontal lobes. We interpret that these later
contusions were brought about when the disruptive force of the injury pushed
that portion of the brain against the relative intact skull.</p>

<p>This has been described as contre-coup injury in that location.</p>

<p>This, then, I believe, Mr. Specter, are the major points with regard to the
President's head wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have an opinion, Dr. Humes, as to whether there were
dumdum bullets used specifically on this wound which struck point "A" of
the head, on 388?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe these were not dumdum bullets, Mr. Specter.
A dumdum bullet is a term that has been used to describe various missiles
which have a common characteristic of fragmenting extensively upon striking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you characterize the resultant effect on this bullet as
not extensive fragmenting?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes. Had this wound on point "A" on Exhibit 388
been inflicted by a dumdum bullet, I would anticipate that it would not have
anything near the regular contour and outline which it had. I also would
anticipate that the skull would have been much more extensively disrupted,
and not have, as was evident in this case, a defect which quite closely corresponded
to the overlying skin defect because that type of a missile would
fragment on contact and be much more disruptive at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At this point would you state for the record the size and approximate
dimension of the major wound on the top of the head which you have
marked wound "B"?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This was so large, that localization of it in a descriptive
way is somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>However, we have mentioned that its major&mdash;its greatest dimension was
approximately 13 cm. The reason it was difficult to measure is that various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
fracture lines extend out from it in a quite irregular fashion, but it was approximately
13 cm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. This red that is marked on 388 on the base of the skull, is
that seepage or what?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir; that is to depict the musculature at the base of
the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is not taken to depict the blood, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the reconstruction of the three portions of the scalp which
you <span class="locked">described&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Skull, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Skull, which enabled you to reconstruct a point of exit of the
bullet, will you state at this point of the record that size of opening or exit
path of the bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. As I mentioned previously, at one angle of this largest
pyramidal shaped fragments of bone which came as a separate specimen, we had
the portion of the perimeter of a roughly what we would judge to have been
a roughly circular wound of exit. Judging from that portion of the perimeter
which was available to us, we would have judged the diameter of that wound
to be between 2.5 and 3 cm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor Humes, have you now described the major characteristics
and features of the wounds to the late President's head?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe that I have, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Will you now turn your attention, please to the wound
which is noted on 385 and 386 being at <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Before we leave that, could I ask a question?</p>

<p>When you talk about dumdum bullets, do you include the ordinary type of
soft nose sporting bullets, maybe this is something that Colonel Finck would
be more expert on, but was that, was the bullet, could it possibly have been
a sporting type of hunting bullet that has a soft nose but is still somewhat
firm?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. From the characteristics of this wound, Mr. McCloy,
I would believe that it must have had a very firm head rather than a soft head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Steel jacketed, would you say, copper jacketed bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe more likely a jacketed bullet because of the
regular outline which was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Believing that we know the type of bullet that was usable in
this gun, would this be the type of wound that might result from that kind of
a bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If my question is <span class="locked">clear&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We think we know what the bullet is, we may be wrong but we
think we know what it was, is this wound consistent with that type of bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Quite consistent, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. There is no evidence of any keyholing of the bullet before it
hit, before the point of impact?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I don't exactly follow your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Was the bullet moving in a direct line or had it begun to
tumble?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. To tumble?</p>

<p>That is a difficult question to answer. I have the opinion, however, that it
was more likely moving in a direct line. You will note that the wound in the
posterior portion of the occiput on Exhibit 388 is somewhat longer than the
other missile wound which we have not yet discussed in the low neck. We
believe that rather than due to a tumbling effect, this is explainable on the
fact that this missile struck the skin and skull at a more tangential angle than
did the other missile, and, therefore, produced a more elongated defect, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask a question there? Perhaps you have done this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
but if not, how would you explain the difference of the courses of the fragments
which you traced and described as, I think, being discovered behind the
right eye?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And the course of the fragment which was believed caused
the large defect?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Caused the large defect?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How do you <span class="locked">explain&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The discrepancy?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The difference in the courses.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>As this missile penetrated the scalp, it then came upon a very firm substance,
the hard skull, and I believe that this track depicted by the dotted lines on
Exhibit 388 was a portion of that missile which was dislodged as it made its
defect in the skull. And that&mdash;that another portion, and, as I say, presumably,
by the size of the defect, a more major portion made its exit through the right
lateral side of the skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is this piece of pyramidal bone that was brought in to you
subsequently as I understand <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Was that part of the outer table or the inner table?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It was both tables, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Both tables?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; had it only been one it might have been difficult
to ascertain whether it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Shelving or not?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; in or out, but it encompassed both tables, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is the angle of declination that you&mdash;one sees there from in and
out approximately the angle you think at which the bullet was traveling at
the time of impact and exit?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is our impression, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So then the shot would have been fired from some point above
the head of the person hit?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, would you elaborate a bit on the differences in the
paths, specifically why the bullet went in one direction in part and in part in
the second direction, terminating with the fragment right over the right eye?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I will make a drawing of the posterior portion of the skull showing again
this beveling which we observed at the inner table of the skull.</p>

<p>Our impression is that as this projectile impinged upon the skull in this
fashion, a small portion of it was dislodged due to the energy expended in that
collision, if you will, and that it went off at an angle, and left the track which
is labeled 388, which is labeled on Exhibit 388 from "A", point "A" to the
point where the fragment was found behind the eye.</p>

<p>Why a fragment takes any particular direction like that is something which
is difficult of scientific explanation. Those of us who have seen missiles strike
bones, be it the skull or a bone in the extremity, have long since learned that
portions of these missiles may go off in various directions and the precise
physical laws governing them are not clearly understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would the angle be accentuated in any way if you were to assume
the President was in a moving automobile going in a slight downhill
direction?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. There are many variables under these circumstances.
The most&mdash;the crucial point, I believe, to be the relative position of the President's
head in relation to the flight of the missile.</p>

<p>Now, this would be influenced by how far his head was bent, by the situation
with regard to the level of the seat in the vehicle, off of the horizontal, and so
forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about a decline in the path of the road itself?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I think that that would have a tendency to accentuate this
angle, yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to move for the admission in
evidence now of Exhibit 391, which is the exhibit on the brain report.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 391 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, would you now move over to the wound which
appears on the lower part of the neck and upper part of the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one more question before we get to that, I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could one say as to what portion of the bullet was found in all
these fragments, I mean arrive at an estimate, was it a tenth of the bullet, was
it, how much was it, assuming the type of bullet that we believe was used in this
particular rifle.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Sir, I have not had the opportunity to personally examine
the type of bullet which is believed to have been represented by this
injury.</p>

<p>However, I would estimate&mdash;if I understand you correctly the total amount
that was present in the President's skull and brain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Including the fragment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Including all the fragments.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Including all these minute particles. I would say there
was something less than one-tenth of the total volume of the missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, do you make that calculation on the assumption
that the bullets used here were 6.5 mm. Mannlicher-Carcano rifle bullet weighing
158.6 grams?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, I do; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had I brought that particular fact to your attention prior to the
time you started testifying here today?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. One point I intended to make clear these fragments
which I recovered from this position were turned over to the Secret
Service.</p>

<p>I presume that they have made physical measurements including the weight
of them, and could give a much more intelligent estimate of the proportion than I.
I would say, however, that we did not deliver these minute fragments because
they were so small as to be essentially unrecoverable.</p>

<p>So, obviously they were of a very small portion of the major missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These minute fragments were part of the bullet, emanations
from the bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They were not from the head?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir, they were small, dust, of the size of dust particles,
however.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is the posture of the head of that figure there, the inclination
of it, roughly the inclination that you think the President's head had at the time
from the other photographs?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. From the photographs and based on the physical
examination of this wound, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is all I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Perhaps this was something that Colonel Finck could testify to
exactly, but, he would be quite competent. Is there anything to indicate that
this was, might have been a larger than a 6.5 or smaller than a 6.5?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The size of the defect in the scalp, caused by a projectile
could vary from missile to missile because of elastic recoil and so forth of the
tissues.</p>

<p>However, the size of the defect in the underlying bone is certainly not likely
to get smaller than that of the missile which perforated it, and in this case,
the smallest diameter of this was approximately 6 to 7 mm., so I would feel that
that would be the absolute upper limit of the size of this missile, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Seven would be the absolute upper limit?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; and, of course, just a little tilt could make it a
little larger, you see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have one other question, if I may.</p>

<p>Is the incidence of clean entry as indicated there, and then great fragmentation
on exit, is that a normal consequence of this type of wound?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Sir, we feel that there are two potential explanations
for this.</p>

<p>One, having traversed the skull in entrance in the occiput as depicted on 388, the
missile begins to tumble, and in that fashion it presents a greater proportion of
its surface to the brain substance and to the skull as it makes its egress.</p>

<p>The other and somewhat more difficult to measure and perhaps Colonel Finck
will be able to testify in greater detail on this, is that a high velocity missile
has tremendous kinetic energy, and this energy is expanded against the structures
which it strikes, and so that much of this defect could be of the nature of
blast, as this kinetic energy is dissipated by traversing the skull.</p>

<p>Is that the sense of the question, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I will ask a question, and perhaps this isn't in your field.</p>

<p>But assuming that the shot which struck President Kennedy at point A
was fired by a gun from the window of the Texas School Book Depository, and
which has been testified to, and assuming that you could locate the position
of the President at the time he was struck by a bullet, you could then, could
you not, establish the degree of the missile?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The degree of angle?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The angle, yes, the degree of angle of the missile from the
building.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; there is one difficulty, and that is the defect of
exit was so broad that one has to rely more on the inclination of the entrance
than they do connecting in this instance entrance and exit because so much
of the skull was carried away in this fashion.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That was my second question.</p>

<p>My first question was would it be possible physically to establish the degree
of angle of the trajectory of the bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Within limited accuracy, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Within limited accuracy.</p>

<p>That being true then my second question was whether the point of entry
of the bullet, point A, and the, what you call the <span class="locked">exit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Exit.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you establish them so exactly that they could be related
to the degree of angle of the trajectory of the bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; to our satisfaction we did ascertain that fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just one other question.</p>

<p>Am I correct in assuming from what you have said that this wound is
entirely inconsistent with a wound that might have been administered if
the shot were fired from in front or the side of the President: it had to be
fired from behind the President?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Scientifically, sir, it is impossible for it to have been
fired from other than behind. Or to have exited from other than behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. This is so obvious that I rather hesitate to ask it. There is
no question in your mind that it was a lethal bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The President, sir, could not possibly have survived
the effect of that injury no matter what would have been done for him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What conclusions did you reach then as to the trajectory or
point of origin of the bullet, Dr. Humes, based on 388?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. We reached the conclusion that this missile was fired
toward the President from a point above and behind him, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, on one detail on your report, Dr. Humes, on page 4, on the
third line down, you note that there is a lacerated wound measuring 15 by 6 mm.
which on the smaller size is, of course, less than 6.5 mm.?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would be the explanation for that variation?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This is in the scalp, sir, and I believe that this is explainable
on the elastic recoil of the tissues of the skin, sir. It is not infrequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
in missile wounds of this type that the measured wound is slightly
smaller than the caliber of the missile that traversed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you proceed, now then to the other major wound of
entry which you have already noted and described?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Its point of origin, where it hit the President.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I&mdash;our previously submitted report, which is Commission
No. 387, identified a wound in the low posterior neck of the President.</p>

<p>The size of this wound was 4 by 7 mm., with the long axis being in accordance
with the long axis of the body, 44 mm. wide, in other words, 7 mm. long.</p>

<p>We attempted to locate such wounds in soft tissue by making reference to
bony structures which do not move and are, therefore, good reference points for
this type of investigation.</p>

<p>We then ascertained, we chose the two bony points of reference&mdash;we chose
to locate this wound, where the mastoid process, which is just behind the ear,
the top of the mastoid process, and the acromion which is the tip of the shoulder
joint. We ascertained physical measurement at the time of autopsy that this
wound was 14 cm. from the tip of the mastoid process and 14 cm. from the
acromion was its central <span class="locked">point&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is the right acromion?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The tip of the right acromion, yes, sir, and that is why
we have depicted it in figure 385 in this location.</p>

<p>This wound appeared physically quite similar to the wound which we have
described before in 388 "A," with the exception that its long axis was shorter
than the long axis of the wound described above. When the tissues beneath this
wound were inspected, there was a defect corresponding with the skin defect
in the fascia overlying the musculature of the low neck and upper back.</p>

<p>I mentioned previously that X-rays were made of the entire body of the late
President. Of course, and here I must say that as I describe something to you,
I might have done it before or after in the description but for the sake of
understanding, we examined carefully the bony structures in this vicinity as
well as the X-rays, to see if there was any evidence of fracture or of deposition
of metallic fragments in the depths of this wound, and we saw no such evidence,
that is no fracture of the bones of the shoulder girdle, or of the vertical column,
and no metallic fragments were detectable by X-ray examination.</p>

<p>Attempts to probe in the vicinity of this wound were unsuccessful without
fear of making a false passage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by that, Doctor?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Well, the defect in the fascia was quite similar, which
is the first firm tissue over the muscle beneath the skin, was quite similar to
this. We were unable, however, to take probes and have them satisfactorily
fall through any definite path at this point.</p>

<p>Now, to explain the situation in the President's neck, I think it will be necessary
for me to refer back to Exhibit 385, I believe the number is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; please do, that is 385.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Now, as the President's body was viewed from anteriorly
in the autopsy room, and saying nothing for the moment about the missile,
there was a recent surgical defect in the low anterior neck, which measured
some 7 or 8 cm. in length or let's say a recent wound was present in this area.</p>

<p>This wound was through the skin, through the subcutaneous tissues and into
the larynx. Or rather into the trachea of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To digress <span class="locked">chronologically&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to discuss that wound on the front side
of the President with Dr. Malcolm Perry of Parkland Hospital in Dallas?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; I did. I had the impression from seeing the
wound that it represented a surgical tracheotomy wound, a wound frequently
made by surgeons when people are in respiratory distress to give them a free
airway.</p>

<p>To ascertain that point, I called on the telephone Dr. Malcolm Perry and
discussed with him the situation of the President's neck when he first examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
the President, and asked him had he in fact done a tracheotomy which was
somewhat redundant because I was somewhat certain he had.</p>

<p>He said, yes; he had done a tracheotomy and that as the point to perform
his tracheotomy he used a wound which he had interpreted as a missile wound
in the low neck, as the point through which to make the tracheotomy incision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you have that conversation with him, Dr. Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I had that conversation early on Saturday morning, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On Saturday morning, November 23d?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you had occasion since to examine the report of
Parkland Hospital which I made available to you?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May it please the Commission, I would like to note this as Commission
Exhibit No. 392, and subject to later technical proof, to have it admitted
into evidence at this time for the purpose of having the doctor comment about it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be so marked.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 392, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did your examination of the Parkland Hospital records
disclose with respect to this wound on the front side of the President's body?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The examination of this record from Parkland Hospital
revealed that Doctor Perry had observed this wound as had other physicians
in attendance upon the President, and actually before a tracheotomy was performed
surgically, an endotracheal tube was placed through the President's
mouth and down his larynx and into his trachea which is the first step in giving
satisfactory airway to a person injured in such fashion and unconscious.</p>

<p>The President was unconscious and it is most difficult to pass such a tube when
the person is unconscious.</p>

<p>The person who performed that procedure, that is instilled the endotracheal
tube noted that there was a wound of the trachea below the larynx, which
corresponded in essence with the wound of the skin which they had observed
from the exterior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How is that wound described, while you are mentioning the
wound?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I think you will find that on the first page of the summary
sheet, Dr. Humes.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. Thank you.</p>

<p>This report was written by doctor&mdash;or of the activities of Dr. James Carrico,
Doctor Carrico in inserting the endotracheal tube noted a ragged wound of
trachea immediately below the larynx.</p>

<p>The report, as I recall it, and I have not studied it in minute detail, would
indicate to me that Doctor Perry realizing from Doctor Carrico's observation
that there was a wound of the trachea would quite logically use the wound
which he had observed as a point to enter the trachea since the trachea was
almost damaged, that would be a logical place in which to put his incision.</p>

<p>In speaking of that wound in the neck, Doctor Perry told me that before he
enlarged it to make the tracheotomy wound it was a "few millimeters in
diameter."</p>

<p>Of course by the time we saw it, as my associates and as you have heard, it
was considerably larger and no longer at all obvious as a missile wound.</p>

<p>The report states, and Doctor Perry told me in telephone conversation that
there was bubbling of air and blood in the vicinity of this wound when he made
the tracheotomy. This caused him to believe that perhaps there had been a
violation of one of the&mdash;one or other of the pleural cavities by a missile. He,
therefore, asked one of his associates, and the record is to me somewhat confused
as to which of his associates, he asked one of his associates to put in a chest
tube. This is a maneuver which is, was quite logical under the circumstances,
and which would, if a tube that were placed through all layers of the wall of
the chest, and the chest cavity had been violated one could remove air that
had gotten in there and greatly assist respiration.</p>

<p>So when we examined the President in addition to the large wound which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
we found in conversation with Doctor Perry was the tracheotomy wound, there
were two smaller wounds on the upper anterior chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These are apparently exit wounds?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Sir, these were knife wounds, these were incised wounds
on either side of the chest, and I will give them in somewhat greater detail.</p>

<p>These wounds were bilateral, they were situated on the anterior chest wall
in the nipple line, and each were 2 cm. long in the transverse axis. The one on
the right was situated 11 cm. above the nipple&mdash;the one on the left was situated
11 cm. on the nipple, and the one on the right was 8 cm. above the nipple. Their
intention was to incise through the President's chest to place tubes into his chest.</p>

<p>We examined those wounds very carefully, and found that they, however,
did not enter the chest cavity. They only went through the skin.</p>

<p>I presume that as they were performing that procedure it was obvious that
the President had died, and they didn't pursue this.</p>

<p>To complete the examination of the area of the neck and the chest, I will
do that together, we made the customary incision which we use in a routine
postmortem examination which is a Y-shaped incision from the shoulders over
the lower portion of the breastbone and over to the opposite shoulder and
reflected the skin and tissues from the anterior portion of the chest.</p>

<p>We examined in the region of this incised surgical wound which was the
tracheotomy wound and we saw that there was some bruising of the muscles of
the neck in the depths of this wound as well as laceration or defect in the trachea.</p>

<p>At this point, of course, I am unable to say how much of the defect in the
trachea was made by the knife of the surgeon, and how much of the defect
was made by the missile wound. That would have to be ascertained from the
surgeon who actually did the tracheotomy.</p>

<p>There was, however, some ecchymosis or contusion, of the muscles of the
right anterior neck inferiorly, without, however, any disruption of the muscles
or any significant tearing of the muscles.</p>

<p>The muscles in this area of the body run roughly, as you see as he depicted
them here. We have removed some of them for a point I will make in a moment,
but it is our opinion that the missile traversed the neck and slid between these
muscles and other vital structures with a course in the neck such as the carotid
artery, the jugular vein and other structures because there was no massive
hemorrhage or other massive injury in this portion of the neck.</p>

<p>In attempting to relate findings within the President's body to this wound
which we had observed low in his neck, we then opened his chest cavity, and
we very carefully examined the lining of his chest cavity and both of his lungs.
We found that there was, in fact, no defect in the pleural lining of the President's
chest.</p>

<p>It was completely intact.</p>

<p>However, over the apex of the right pleural cavity, and the pleura now has
two layers. It has a parietal or a layer which lines the chest cavity and it has a
visceral layer which is intimately in association with the lung.</p>

<p>As depicted in figure 385, in the apex of the right pleural cavity there was
a bruise or contusion or ecchmymosis of the parietal pleura as well as a bruise
of the upper portion, the most apical portion of the right lung.</p>

<p>It, therefore, was our opinion that the missile while not penetrating physically
the pleural cavity, as it passed that point bruised either the missile itself, or
the force of its passage through the tissues, bruised both the parietal and the
visceral pleura.</p>

<p>The area of discoloration on the apical portion of the right upper lung
measured five centimeters in greatest diameter, and was wedge shaped in configuration,
with its base toward the top of the chest and its apex down towards
the substance of the lung.</p>

<p>Once again Kodachrome photographs were made of this area in the interior
of the President's chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you mark the point on Exhibit 385, the one on the rear
of the President as point "C" and the one on the front of the President as
point "D" so we can discuss those, Dr. Humes?</p>

<p>Now, what conclusion did you reach, if any, as to whether point "C" was the
point of entry or exit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. We reached the conclusion that point "C" was a point
of entry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What characteristics of that wound led you to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The characteristics here were basically similar to the
characteristics above, lacking one very valuable clue or piece of evidence rather
than clue, because it is more truly a piece of evidence in the skull. The skull
as I mentioned before had the bone with the characteristic defect made as a
missile traverses bone.</p>

<p>This missile, to the best of our ability to ascertain, struck no bone protuberances,
no bony prominences, no bones as it traversed the President's body.
But it was a sharply delineated wound. It was quite regular in its outline.
It measured, as I mentioned, 7 by 4 mm. Its margins were similar in all
respects when viewed with the naked eye to the wound in the skull, which we
feel incontrovertibly was a wound of entrance.</p>

<p>The defect in the fascia which is that layer of connective tissue over the
muscle just beneath the wound corresponded virtually exactly to the defect in
the skin.</p>

<p>And for these reasons we felt that this was a wound of entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you search the body to determine if there was any bullet
inside the body?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Before the arrival of Colonel Finck we had made X-rays
of the head, neck and torso of the President, and the upper portions of his
major extremities, or both his upper and lower extremities. At Colonel Finck's
suggestion, we then completed the X-ray examination by X-raying the President's
body in toto, and those X-rays are available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did those X-rays disclose with respect to the possible
presence of a missile in the President's body?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. They showed no evidence of a missile in the President's
body at any point. And these were examined by ourselves and by the radiologist,
who assisted us in this endeavor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What conclusion, if any, did you reach as to whether point "D"
on 385 was the point of entrance or exit?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. We concluded that this missile depicted in 385 "C"
which entered the President's body traversed the President's body and made
its exit through the wound observed by the physicians at Parkland Hospital
and later extended as a tracheotomy wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does the description "ragged wound" which is found in the
Parkland report shed any light in and of itself as to whether point "D" is an
exit or entry wound?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe, sir, that that statement goes on, ragged wound
in the trachea. I don't believe that refers to the skin. And you might say
that it is a ragged wound is more likely to be a wound of exit.</p>

<p>However, the trachea has little cartilaginous rings which have a tendency,
which would be disrupted by this, and most wounds of the trachea unless very
cleverly incised would perhaps appear slightly ragged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what was the angle, if any, that you observed on the path
of the bullet, as you outlined it?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The angle which we observed in measuring, in comparing
the point of entrance, our point of entrance labeled "C" on 385 and "D"
point of exit is one that the point of exit is below the point of entrance compared
with the vertical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had an opportunity to examine the clothing which
has been identified for you as being that worn by the President on the day of
the assassination?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes; yesterday, just shortly before the Commission hearing
today was begun, Mr. Chief Justice, we had opportunity for the first time
to examine the clothing worn by the late President.</p>

<p>In private conversation among ourselves before this opportunity, we predicted
we would find defects in the clothing corresponding with the defects
which were found, of course, on the body of the late President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Commission, I would like
to have identified for the record three articles on which I have placed Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
Exhibits Nos. 393 being the coat worn by the President, 394 being the
shirt, and 395 being the President's tie, and at this time move for their admission
into evidence.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The articles of clothing referred to were marked Commission Exhibits
Nos. 393, 394 and 395 for identification, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Taking 393 at the start, Doctor Humes, will you describe for
the record what hole, if any, is observable in the back of that garment which
would be at or about the spot you have described as being the point of entry
on the President's back or lower neck.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. This exhibit is a grey suit coat stated to
have been worn by the President on the day of his death. Situated to the
right of the midline high in the back portion of the coat is a defect, one margin
of which is semicircular.</p>

<p>Situated above it just below the collar is an additional defect. It is our
opinion that the lower of these defects corresponds essentially with the point
of entrance of the missile at Point C on Exhibit 385.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would it be accurate to state that the hole which you have
identified as being the point of entry is approximately 6 inches below the top
of the collar, and 2 inches to the right of the middle seam of the coat?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is approximately correct, sir. This defect, I might
say, continues on through the material.</p>

<p>Attached to this garment is the memorandum which states that one half of
the area around the hole which was presented had been removed by experts,
I believe, at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and also that a control area
was taken from under the collar, so it is my interpretation that this defect at
the top of this garment is the control area taken by the Bureau, and that the
reason the lower defect is not more circle or oval in outline is because a portion
of that defect has been removed apparently for physical examinations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, does the one which you have described as the entry of the
bullet go all the way through?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; it goes through both layers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the upper one of the collar you have described, does
that go all the way through?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; it goes all the way through. It is not&mdash;wait a
minute, excuse me&mdash;it is not so clearly a puncture wound as the one below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does the upper one go all the way through in the same course?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Through the inner side as it went through the outer side?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, in an irregular fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you take Commission Exhibit 394 and describe what that is,
first of all, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This is the shirt, blood-stained shirt, purportedly worn
by the President on the day of his assassination. When viewed from behind
at a point which corresponds essentially with the point of defect on the jacket,
one sees an irregularly oval defect.</p>

<p>When viewed anteriorly, with the top button buttoned, two additional defects
are seen. Of course, with the shirt buttoned, the fly front of the shirt causes two
layers of cloth to be present in this location, and that there is a defect in the
inner layer of cloth and a corresponding defect in the outer layer of the cloth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any observable indication from the fibers on the front
side of the shirt to indicate in which direction a missile might have passed
through those two tears?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. From an examination of these defects at this point, it
would appear that the missile traversed these two layers from within to the
exterior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would it be accurate to state that the hole in the back of the
shirt is approximately 6 inches below the top of the collar and 2 inches to the
right of the middle seam of the shirt?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is approximately correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, how, if at all, do the holes in the shirt and coat conform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
to the wound of entrance which you described as point "C" on Commission Exhibit
385?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. We believe that they conform quite well. When viewing&mdash;first
of all, the wounds or the defects in 393 and 394 coincide virtually
exactly with one another.</p>

<p>They give the appearance when viewed separately and not as part of the
clothing of a clothed person as being perhaps, somewhat lower on the Exhibits
393 and 394 than we have depicted them in Exhibit No. 385. We believe there are
two reasons for this.</p>

<p>385 is a schematic representation, and the photographs would be more accurate
as to the precise location, but more particularly the way in which these defects
would conform with such a defect on the torso would depend on the girth of the
shoulders and configuration of the base of the neck of the individual, and the
relative position of the shirt and coat to the tissues of the body at the time of
the impact of the missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to the muscular status of the President, what was it?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The President was extremely well-developed, an extremely
well-developed, muscular young man with a very well-developed set of
muscles in his thoraco and shoulder girdle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What effect would that have on the positioning of the shirt and
coat with respect to the position of the neck in and about the seam?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe this would have a tendency to push the portions
of the coat which show the defects here somewhat higher on the back of the
President than on a man of less muscular development.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Commission, I would like to
mark for identification Exhibit 396, which later proof will show is a picture of
President Kennedy shortly before the first bullet struck him, and ask the doctor
to take a look at that.</p>

<p>Will you describe, Doctor Humes, the position of President Kennedy's right
hand in that picture?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes. This exhibit, Commission Exhibit No. 396, allegedly
taken just prior to the wounding of the late President, shows him with his hand
raised, his elbow bent, apparently in saluting the crowd. I believe that this
<span class="locked">action&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which hand was that?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This was his right hand, sir. I believe that this action
would further accentuate the elevation of the coat and the shirt with respect
to the back of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now. Doctor Humes, will you take Commission Exhibit No.
<span class="locked">395&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Before you go, may I ask a question? In your examination of
the shirt, I just want to get it in the record, from your examination of the shirt,
there is no defect in the collar of the shirt which coincides with the defect in
the back of the President's coat, am I correct?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. You are correct, sir. There is no such defect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to Commission Exhibit 395, Dr. Humes, will you identify
what that is, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. We had an opportunity to examine this exhibit before
the Commission met today, sir. This is Commission Exhibit No. 395, and is the
neck tie purportedly worn, purportedly to have been worn, by the late President
on the day of his assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What defect, if any, is noted on the tie which would correspond
with the path of a missile apparently passing through the folds of the shirt
which you have already described?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This tie is one of those&mdash;this tie is still in its knotted
state, as we examine it at this time. The portion of the tie around the neck
has been severed apparently with scissors or other sharp instrument accounting
for the loop about the neck.</p>

<p>The tie is tied in four-in-hand fashion but somewhat askew from the way
a person would normally tie a four-in-hand knot.</p>

<p>Situated on the left anterior aspect of this knotted portion of the tie at a
point approximately corresponding with the defects noted previously in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
two layers of the shirt is a superficial tear of the outer layer only of the fabric
of this tie which, I believe, could have been caused by a glancing blow to this
portion of the tie by a missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I move at this time for the admission into
evidence of Exhibits 393 through Exhibit 396, the three articles of clothing and
the photograph which we have just used.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(Exhibits Nos. 393 through 396 were received in evidence and may be found
in the Commission files.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Commander, did you say left or right?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir. In fact, the way this bow is tied now it would
appear to be on the left of this tie, but it is kind of twisted out of shape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes. It is twisted. It is not too clear.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It is not too clear, it is not clear how that might have
been in position with the shirt, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, Doctor Humes, at one point in your examination of the
President, did you make an effort to probe the point of entry with your finger?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at or about that time when you were trying to ascertain,
as you previously testified, whether there was any missile in the body of the
President, did someone from the Secret Service call your attention to the fact
that a bullet had been found on a stretcher at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in that posture of your examination, having just learned
of the presence of a bullet on a stretcher, did that call to your mind any tentative
explanatory theory of the point of entry or exit of the bullet which you have
described as entering at Point "C" on Exhibit 385?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. We were able to ascertain with absolute certainty
that the bullet had passed by the apical portion of the right lung producing
the injury which we mentioned.</p>

<p>I did not at that point have the information from Doctor Perry about the
wound in the anterior neck, and while that was a possible explanation for the
point of exit, we also had to consider the possibility that the missile in some
rather inexplicable fashion had been stopped in its path through the President's
body and, in fact, then had fallen from the body onto the stretcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what theory did you think possible, at that juncture, to
explain the passing of the bullet back out the point of entry; or had you been
provided with the fact that external heart massage had been performed on
the President?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; we had, and we considered the possibility that
some of the physical maneuvering performed by the doctors might have in
some way caused this event to take place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you since discounted that possibility, Doctor Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes; in essence we have. When examining the wounds
in the base of the President's neck anteriorly, the region of the tracheotomy
performed at Parkland Hospital, we noted, and we noted in our record, some
contusion and bruising of the muscles of the neck of the President. We noted
that at the time of the postmortem examination.</p>

<p>Now, we also made note of the types of wounds which I mentioned to you
before in this testimony on the chest which were going to be used by the
doctors there to place chest tubes. They also made other wounds, one on the
left arm, and a wound on the ankle of the President with the idea of administering
intravenous blood and other fluids in hope of replacing the blood which
the President had lost from his extensive wounds.</p>

<p>Those wounds showed no evidence of bruising or contusion or physical violence,
which made us reach the conclusion that they were performed during
the agonal moments of the late president, and when the circulation was, in
essence, very seriously embarrassed, if not nonfunctional. So that these wounds,
the wound of the chest and the wound of the arm and of the ankle were performed
about the same time as the tracheotomy wound because only a very few
moments of time elapsed when all this was going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
So, therefore, we reached the conclusion that the damage to these muscles
on the anterior neck just below this wound were received at approximately the
same time that the wound here on the top of the pleural cavity was, while
the President still lived and while his heart and lungs were operating in such
a fashion to permit him to have a bruise in the vicinity, because that he did
have in these strap muscles in the neck, but he didn't have in the areas of the
other incisions that were made at Parkland Hospital. So we feel that, had this
missile not made its path in that fashion, the wound made by Doctor Perry in
the neck would not have been able to produce, wouldn't have been able to produce,
these contusions of the musculature of the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question about the missile, I am a little bit&mdash;the
bullet, I am a little bit&mdash;confused. It was found on the stretcher. Did the
President's body remain on the stretcher while it was in the hospital?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Of that point I have no knowledge. The <span class="locked">only&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Why would it&mdash;would this operating have anything to do with
the bullet being on the stretcher unless the President's body remained on the
stretcher after he was taken into the hospital; is that possible?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It is quite possible, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Otherwise it seems to me the bullet would have to have been
ejected from the body before he was taken or put on the bed in the hospital.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Right, sir. I, of course, was not there. I don't know
how he was handled in the hospital, in what conveyance. I do know he was
on his back during the period of his stay in the hospital; Doctor Perry told me
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes; and wasn't turned over.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So he might have been on the stretcher the whole time, is that
your view?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. He said he had no view. He wasn't there, he doesn't know
anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. I wonder if there is other evidence of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. There has been other evidence, Mr. Dulles. If I may say at
this point, we shall produce later, subject to sequential proof, evidence that
the stretcher on which this bullet was found was the stretcher of Governor
Connally. We have a sequence of events on the transmission of that stretcher
which ties that down reasonably closely, so that on the night of the autopsy
itself, as the information I have been developing indicates, the thought preliminarily
was that was from President Kennedy's stretcher, and that is what
led to the hypothesis which we have been exploring about, but which has since
been rejected. But at any rate the evidence will show that it was from Governor
Connally's stretcher that the bullet was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So this bullet is still missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is the subject of some theories I am about to get into.
That is an elusive subject, but Dr. Humes has some views on it, and we might
just as well go into those now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Before he gets into that, may I ask a question?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Surely, go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Quite apart from the President's clothing, now directing your
attention to the flight of the bullet, quite apart from the evidence given by the
President's clothing, you, I believe, indicated that the flight of the bullet was
from the back, from above and behind. It took roughly the line which is shown
on your Exhibit 385.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I am not clear what induced you to come to that conclusion if
you couldn't find the actual exit wound by reason of the tracheotomy.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The report which we have submitted, sir, represents our
thinking within the 24&ndash;48 hours of the death of the President, all facts taken
into account of the situation.</p>

<p>The wound in the anterior portion of the lower neck is physically lower than
the point of entrance posteriorly, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is what I wanted to bring out.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask this: In spite of the incision made by the tracheotomy,
was there any evidence left of the exit aperture?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Unfortunately not that we could ascertain, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There is no evidence in the coat or the shirt of an exit through
the coat or shirt.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. There is no exit through the coat, sir. But these two,
in the shirt, of course&mdash;excuse me, sir&mdash;there is. The entrance by our
<span class="locked">calculations&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The entrance I know.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Posteriorly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What about the exit?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The exit wounds are just below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But there was no coat to exit through.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No; anteriorly the coat was quite open.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir, Senator.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Assuming that we draw a straight line from Point "C" which
you have described as a possible point of entry of the missile, to Point "D"
where you saw an incision of the <span class="locked">tracheotomy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What would be the relation of the bruise at the apex of the
pleural sac to such a line?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It would be exactly in line with such a line, sir, exactly.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was the character of the bruise that you saw there?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The bruise here, photographs are far superior to my
humble verbal description, but if I let my hand in cup shaped fashion represent
the apical parietal pleura, it was an area approximately 5 cm. in greatest
diameter of purplish blue discoloration of the parietal pleura. Corresponding
exactly with it, with the lung sitting below it, was a roughly pyramid-shaped
bruise with its base toward the surface of the upper portion of the lung, and
the apex down into the lung tissue, and the whole thing measured about 5 cm.,
which is a little&mdash;2 inches in extent, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What would be the&mdash;can you describe the covering around
the apex of the pleural sac, the nature of its protection. My point is to get
your opinion as to whether some other factor, some factor other than the missile
could have caused this bruise which you saw.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. A couple of ways we might do this, sir. One with regard
to temporal, it was quite fresh. When examined under the microscope, the lung
in this area had recent hemorrhaging in it. The red blood cells were well-preserved,
as they would be if it happened quite recently before death, as was
the red blood cells where they had gotten out into the lung tissue near there.</p>

<p>The discoloration was essentially of the same character as the discoloration
in the muscles adjacent thereto, which would roughly again place it temporally
in approximately the same time since bruises change color as time goes by, and
these appeared quite fresh.</p>

<p>This is with regard to time&mdash;I don't know whether that is the right parameter
in which you wished to study it, Senator.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. My question really went to this point: Considering the location
of the bruise at the apex of the pleural <span class="locked">sac&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And of the tissue or muscles around it, was there any other
factor which you could think of that might have caused that bruise other than
the passage of a missile?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It was so well localized that I truthfully, sir, can't think
of any other way.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask you one question which, perhaps, the answer is quite
obvious. If, contrary to the evidence that we have here, that anterior wound
was the wound of entry, the shot must have come from below the President to
have followed that path.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That course, that is correct, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, can you compare the angles of declination on 385,
point "C" to "D", with 388 "A" to "B"?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. You will note, and again I must apologize for the schematic
nature of these diagrams drawn to a certain extent from memory and to
a certain extent from the written record, it would appear that the angle of
declination is somewhat sharper in the head wound, 388, than it is in 385.</p>

<p>The reason for this, we feel, by the pattern of the entrance wound at 388 "A"
causes us to feel that the President's head was bent forward, and we feel this
accounts for the difference in the angle, plus undoubtedly the wounds were not
received absolutely simultaneously, so that the vehicle in which the President
was traveling moved during this period of time, which would account for a
difference in the line of flight, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from the slight differences which are notable by observing
those two exhibits, are they roughly comparable to the angle of decline?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe them to be roughly comparable, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you state for the record an approximation of the angle of
decline?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Mathematics is not my forte. Approximately 45 degrees
from the horizontal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you elaborate somewhat, Doctor Humes, on why the
angle would change by virtue of a tilting of the head of the President since
the basis of the computation of angle is with respect to the ground?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I find the question a little difficult of answering right off,
forgive me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will try to rephrase it. Stated more simply, why would the
tilting of the President's head affect the angle of the decline? You stated that
<span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The angle that I am making an observation most about
is the angle made that we envisioned having been made by the impingement of
the bullet in its flight at the point of entry. This angle we see by the difference
of the measurement of the two wounds.</p>

<p>Therefore, this is&mdash;we have several angles we are talking about here, unfortunately,
this is&mdash;the angle of which we speak in this location, "A" to "B",
and it is difficult.</p>

<p>I have to retract. Since we feel from their physical configurations, wounds
385 "C" and 388 "A" are entrance wounds, if there wasn't some significant
change in the angulation of the President's head with respect to the line of
flight from these missiles, the physical measurements of 385 "C" and this 388
"A" should be similar. They aren't, in fact, dissimilar in that there is a greater
angulation in 388 "A". Therefore, there has to be either a change in the position
of the vehicle in which the President is riding with respect to the horizontal
or a change in the situation of the President's head. I believe that the exhibits
submitted earlier, the <span class="locked">photograph&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I believe the ones were given to you so far&mdash;excuse me, you are
right, 389.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. 389, in fact at this point shows the President's head in
a slightly inclined forward position, and I am not enough aware of the geography
of the ground over which the vehicle was traveling to know how much that
would affect it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you were to be told that there was a distance traversed of
approximately 150 feet from the time of Point "C" on 385 to Point "A" on 388,
and you would assume the additional factor that there was a slight angle of
decline on the street as well, would those factors, assuming them to be true,
help in the explanation of the differences in the angles?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I think that they would make the figure as depicted in
388 quite understandably different from 385.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was it possible, in view of the condition of the brain to point
with absolute accuracy to the point of exit there? I can see that the point of
exit in 385 can be clearly determined. Is it equally possible to determine the
point of exit in 388?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir; it was not, other than through this large defect
because <span class="locked">when&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Therefore, that angle might be somewhat different.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Might be somewhat different, sir. I think we made reference
to that somewhat earlier. The fragments were so difficult to replace in
their precise anatomic <span class="locked">location&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is what I thought, but I wasn't sure.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I would like to ask a question in regard to 385 similar to that I
asked as to 388. In your opinion, was the 385 wound lethal?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. With the wound in 385, would it have affected the President's
power of speech?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It could have, sir. The wound caused a defect in his
trachea which would most usually have caused at least some defect in the proper
phonation, sir.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In response to Mr. Dulles' question a moment ago, Doctor Humes,
you commented that they did not turn him over at Parkland. Will you state
for the record what the source of your information is on that?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes. This is a result of a personal telephone conversation
between myself and Dr. Malcolm Perry early in the morning of Saturday,
November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At that time did Doctor Perry tell you specifically, Doctor Humes,
that the Parkland doctors had not observed the wound in the President's back?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. He told me that the President was on his back from the
time he was brought into the hospital until the time he left it, and that at no
time was he turned from his back by the doctors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at the time of your conversation with Doctor Perry did
you tell Doctor Perry anything of your observations or conclusions?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>(A short recess was taken.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, the Commission will be in order. We will continue
with the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor Humes, as to points of entry on the body of the late
President, how many were there in total?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Two, sir, as depicted in 385-C and 388-A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And to points of exit, how many were there?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Two, sir, as depicted in 385-D and the vicinity of 388-B.
I make the latter remark as was developed earlier, in that the size of the large
defect in the skull was so great and the fragmentation was so complex that it
was impossible to accurately pinpoint the exit of the missile in the head wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now as to that last factor, would the X-rays be of material assistance
to you in pinpointing the specific locale of the exit?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I do not believe so, sir. The only path that the X-rays
show in any detail are of the minor fragments which passed from point A
to point B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now that you have finished your major descriptions of the
wounds, can you be any more specific in telling us in what way the availability
of the x-rays would assist in further specifying the nature of the wounds?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I do not believe, sir, that the availability of the X-rays
would materially assist the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the same question as to the pictures?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The pictures would show more accurately and in more detail
the character of the wounds as depicted particularly in 385 and 386
and in 388-A. They would also perhaps give the Commissioners a better&mdash;better
is not the best term, but a more graphic picture of the massive defect
in 388.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going back for a moment, Doctor <span class="locked">Humes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Before we get off that, may I ask you this, Commander: If
we had the pictures here and you could look them over again and restate
your opinion, would it cause you to change any of the testimony you have
given here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. To the best of my recollection, Mr. Chief Justice, it
would not.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. McCloy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask this question?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not any photographs
were taken in Dallas?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I have none, sir, no knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. No knowledge that any were taken?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask what size are the pictures to which you refer?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. We exposed both black and white and color negatives,
Congressman. They were exposed in the morgue during the examination.
They were not developed. The kodachrome negatives when developed would
be 405. They were in film carriers or cassettes, as were the black and white.
Of course they could be magnified.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have those been examined by personnel at Bethesda?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. No, sir. We exposed these negatives; we turned them
over. Here I must ask the counsel again for advice&mdash;to the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; it was the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. They were turned over to the Secret Service in their
cassettes unexposed, and I have not seen any of them since. This is the photographs.
The X-rays were developed in our X-ray department on the spot that
evening, because we had to see those right then as part of our examination, but
the photographs were made for the record and for other purposes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But they had never been actually developed for viewing.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I do not know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor Humes, back to the angles for just a moment.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Hypothesize or assume, if you will, that other evidence will
show that the wound inflicted on Commission Exhibit 385 at point C occurred
while the President was riding in the rear seat of his automobile approximately
100 feet from a point of origin in a six-floor building nearby, and assume further
that the wound inflicted in 388 at point A occurred when the President
was approximately 250 feet away from the same point.</p>

<p>With those assumptions in mind, there would be somewhat different angles
of declination going from C to D on 385 and from A to B on 388.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I would expect there would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have already testified earlier today that you were unable
to pinpoint with precision angle A to B on 388 because of the reconstruction
of the scalp.</p>

<p>Now my question to you, in that elongated fashion, is from what you know
and what you have described, are the angles, as you have expressed them to
be in your opinion, consistent with a situation where the two wounds were
inflicted at the angles and at the distances just described to you?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe they are consistent. I would state that the path
outlined on 388-A to B is to a certain extent conjectural for the reasons given
before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, Doctor Humes, I hand you a group of documents which
have been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 397 and ask you if you can
identify what they are?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; these are various notes in long-hand, or copies
rather, of various notes in long-hand made by myself, in part, during the performance
of the examination of the late President, and in part after the examination
when I was preparing to have a typewritten report made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there also included there some notes that you made while
you talked to Doctor Perry on the telephone?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; there are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any notes which you made at any time which are not
included in this group of notes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; there are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what do those consist of?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. In privacy of my own home, early in the morning of
Sunday, November 24th, I made a draft of this report which I later revised,
and of which this represents the revision. That draft I personally burned in
the fireplace of my recreation room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that the Exhibit No. 397 is the identical
document which has been previously identified as Commission No. 371 for our
internal purposes.</p>

<p>Is the first sheet then in that group the notes you made when you talked to
Doctor Perry?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do the next 15 sheets represent the rough draft which was
later copied into the autopsy report which has been heretofore identified with
an exhibit number?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what do the next two sheets represent?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The next two sheets are the notes actually made in the
room in which the examination was taking place. I notice now that the
handwriting in some instances is not my own, and it is either that of Commander
Boswell or Colonel Finck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was that writing made at the same time that the autopsy
report was undertaken; that is, did you review all of the markings on those
papers and note them to be present when you completed the autopsy report?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir. From the time of the completion of this examination
until the submission of the written report following its preparation,
all of the papers pertinent to this case were in my personal custody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described all of the documents which were present
in that 397, Exhibit No. 397?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; with the exception of the certification to the
fact that I, in fact, detailed them in my custody, and a certification that I had
destroyed certain preliminary draft notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And these represent all the notes except those you have already
described which you destroyed?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, just one point on the notes themselves. Page 14 of your
rough draft, Doctor Humes, as to the point of origin, the notes show that
there was a revision between your first draft and your final report.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you first of all read into the record the final conclusion
reflected in your final report.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I would rather read it from the final report. The final
report reads:</p>

<p>"The projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above the level
of the deceased."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did the first draft of that sentence as shown on page
14 of your rough draft state?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It stated as follows:</p>

<p>"The projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above a horizontal
line to the vertical position of the body at the moment of impact."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now would you state the reason for making that modification
between draft and final report, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. This examination, as I have indicated, was performed
by myself with my two associates. The notes which we have just admitted as an
exhibit are in my own hand and are my opinion, was my opinion at that time, as
to the best way to present the facts which we had gleaned during this period.</p>

<p>Before submitting it to the typist, I went over this with great care with my two
associates. One or the other of them raised the point that perhaps this sentence
would state more than what was absolutely fact based upon our observations,
pointing out that we did not know precisely at that time in what position the
body of the President was when the missiles struck, and that therefore we
should be somewhat less specific and somewhat more circumspect than the
way we stated it. When I considered this suggestion, I agreed that it would
be better to change it as noted, and accordingly, I did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I move now for the admission into evidence
of Exhibit No. 397.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents, previously marked Exhibit No. 397 for identification, were
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask one question about the notes? The notes that you
made contemporaneously with your examination, you said you put those down
and then you put some in later. How much later were the notes, within the
best of your recollection of the final notes made, not the final report, but the
final notes that you made in your own handwriting?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The examination was concluded approximately at 11
o'clock on the night of November 22. The final changes in the notes prior to
the typing of the report were made, and I will have to give you the time because
whatever time Mr. Oswald was shot, that is about when I finished. I was working
in an office, and someone had a television on and came in and told me that
Mr. Oswald had been shot, and that was around noon on Sunday, November 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I have now marked another photograph as the
next exhibit number, Commission Exhibit 398. May I say to the Commission
that this is a photograph which, subject to later proof, will show it to be taken
immediately after the President was struck by the first bullet.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be marked.</p>

<p>(The photograph was marked Commission Exhibit No. 398 for identification.)</p>

<p>May I move for its admission into evidence at this time for this purpose?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 398 for identification,
was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Looking at Commission Exhibit 398, Doctor Humes, with that as a background,
have you had an opportunity to review the medical reports on Governor Connally
at Parkland Hospital in Commission Exhibit 392?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you noted the wounds which he sustained on his right wrist,
that is, Governor Connally's right wrist?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir; I have noted the report of it in these records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What does the report show as to those wounds on the right wrist?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The report shows a wound of entrance on the dorsal aspect
of the right wrist. Let's get the precise point here. The wound of entry
is described as on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist above the junction of the
distal fourth of the radius and the shaft. It was approximately two centimeters
in length and rather oblique, with the loss of tissue, and some considerable
contusions at the margins. There was a wound of exit along the volar
surface of the wrist about two centimeters above the flexion crease of the wrist
in the midline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor Humes, I show you a bullet which we have marked as
Commission Exhibit No. 399, and may I say now that, subject to later proof, this
is the missile which has been taken from the stretcher which the evidence now
indicates was the stretcher occupied by Governor Connally.</p>

<p>I move for its admission into evidence at this time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 399 for identification,
was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We have been asked by the FBI that the missile not be handled
by anybody because it is undergoing further ballistic tests, and it now appears,
may the record show, in a plastic case in a cotton background.</p>

<p>Now looking at that bullet, Exhibit 399, Doctor Humes, could that bullet have
gone through or been any part of the fragment passing through President Kennedy's
head in Exhibit No. 388?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I do not believe so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And could that missile have made the wound on Governor Connally's
right wrist?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I think that that is most unlikely. May I expand on
those two answers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, please do.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. The X-rays made of the wound in the head of the late
President showed fragmentations of the missile. Some fragments we recovered
and turned over, as has been previously noted. Also we have X-rays of the
fragment of skull which was in the region of our opinion exit wound showing
metallic fragments.</p>

<p>Also going to Exhibit 392, the report from Parkland Hospital, the following
sentence referring to the examination of the wound of the wrist is found:</p>

<p>"Small bits of metal were encountered at various levels throughout the
wound, and these were, wherever they were identified and could be picked up,
picked up and submitted to the pathology department for identification and
examination."</p>

<p>The reason I believe it most unlikely that this missile could have inflicted
either of these wounds is that this missile is basically intact; its jacket appears
to me to be intact, and I do not understand how it could possibly have left
fragments in either of these locations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What wounds did Governor Connally sustain in his chest area,
based upon the records of Parkland Hospital, which you have examined, Doctor
Humes?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Governor Connally received in his chest a wound of entrance
just&mdash;this is again from 392&mdash;"just lateral to the right scapula close to
the axilla which had passed through the lattisimus dorsi muscle, shattered approximately
ten centimeters of a lateral and anterior portion of the right fifth
rib, and emerged below the right nipple anterially."</p>

<p>These were the wounds of the chest of Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now assuming that there were only three missiles fired, and
bearing in mind the positions of President Kennedy and Governor Connally from
the photograph marked Commission Exhibit 398, do you have an opinion as to
the source of the missiles which inflicted the wound on President Kennedy
marked 385-C to D, and the wound in Governor Connally's chest which you have
just referred to?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes. I would preface this statement by the following:
As I testified earlier in the afternoon, as much as we could ascertain from our
X-rays and physical examinations, this missile struck no bony structures in
traversing the body of the late President. Therefore, I believe it was moving at
its exit from the President's body at only very slightly less than that velocity,
so it was still traveling at great speed.</p>

<p>I believe in looking at Exhibit 398, which purports to be at approximately
the time the President was struck, I see that Governor Connally is sitting directly
in front of the late President, and suggest the possibility that this missile,
having traversed the low neck of the late President, in fact traversed the chest
of Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much of the velocity, if any, or would there be an appreciable
diminution of the velocity of the projectile on passing through the
portions of President Kennedy's body which you have described?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I would have to defer to my associate, Colonel Finck,
for an opinion about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine. As to any damage to the rib which you described Governor
Connally sustained, would that impact or trauma be consistent with
the markings which are shown on Exhibit 399?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I think it quite possible. Here I think if this point
were to be explored further, a most valuable piece of evidence would be an
X-ray of the chest of Governor Connally, because I believe that this missile
could have struck the rib a glancing blow.</p>

<p>The rib is a rather rigid structure, and the missile would not have to strike
it directly to cause the fracture that was described, and the fracture is not very
clearly described to me, and if an X-ray, for instance, showed no metallic
fragments in the chest of the Governor, I would think it quite likely that this
was the missile that had traversed his chest, because I doubt if this missile
would have left behind it any metallic fragments from its physical appearance
at this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could that missile have traversed Governor Connally's chest
without having him know it immediately or instantaneously?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I believe so. I have heard reports, and have been told
by my professional associates of any number of instances where people received
penetrating wounds in various portions of the body and have only the
sensation of a slight discomfort or slight slap or some other minor difficulty
from such a missile wound. I am sure he would be aware that something
happened to him, but that he was shot, I am not certain.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would that have been the potential reaction of the
President when first hit, as shown in 385?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. It could very easily be one of some type of an injury&mdash;I
mean the awareness that he had been struck by a missile, I don't know,
but people have been drilled through with a missile and didn't know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Humes, under your opinion which you have just given us,
what effect, if any, would that have on whether this bullet, 399, could have
been the one to lodge in Governor Connally's thigh?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. I think that extremely unlikely. The reports, again
Exhibit 392 from Parkland, tell of an entrance wound on the lower midthigh of
the Governor, and X-rays taken there are described as showing metallic fragments
in the bone, which apparently by this report were not removed and
are still present in Governor Connally's thigh. I can't conceive of where they
came from this missile.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The missile identified as Exhibit 399.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. 399, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor Humes, would you have an opinion as to whether the
wounds on Governor Connally's wrist and thigh were caused by the same
bullet?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. In reading the description of the fragmentation that
was found, fragments were found in the wrist, one fragment was found imbedded
in his femur, I would feel it was definitely within the realm of possibility
that the same missile could have produced both of those injuries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Those are all my questions, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Are there any other questions? If not, thank you very
much, Commander. You have been very helpful to us, indeed.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Commander Boswell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask one more question?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Of course you may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Earlier in the afternoon we had taken out of cellophane bags
here the clothing of the President.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And amongst them was the shirt.</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. From your examination of the wounds, of the defects, I guess
you would call it in the <span class="locked">shirt&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Would you from examining the tissues of that shirt have any
conclusions as to how that wound, how that missile passed through the shirt?
Was it from the rear to the front, or from the front to the rear?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Humes</span>. As I examined that exhibit today, sir, the threads are
fragmented and distorted in such a fashion which would indicate to me that
the missile passed through the shirt from the rear to the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. J. Thornton Boswell, Commander, Medical Corps, U.S.
Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. Physician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you obtain your medical degree, please?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. At the College of Medicine, Ohio State University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what experience have you had in your professional line
subsequent to obtaining that degree?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. I interned in the Navy and took my pathology training
at St. Albans Naval Hospital in New York. I was certified by the American
Board of Pathology in both clinical and pathological anatomy in 1957 and 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your duty assignment at the present time?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. I am the Chief of Pathology at the National Naval
Medical School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to participate in the autopsy of the
late President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you assist Doctor Humes at that time?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been present here today during the entire course of
Doctor Humes' testimony?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. I have, sir; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything that you would like to add by way of
elaboration or modification to that which Doctor Humes has testified?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. None, I believe. Doctor Humes has stated essentially
what is the culmination of our examination and our subsequent conference, and
everything is exactly as we had determined our conclusions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you one of the three coauthors of the autopsy report
which has been previously identified as a Commission Exhibit?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All the facts set forth therein are correct in accordance with
your analysis and evaluation of the situation?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And specifically, as to the points of entry and points of exit
which have been testified to by Doctor Humes, do his views express yours as
well?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. They do, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor Boswell, would you state for the record what your conclusion
was as to the cause of death of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. The brain injury was the cause of death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in the absence of brain injury, what, in your view, would
have been the future status of President Kennedy's mortality, if he had only
sustained the wound inflicted in 385?</p>

<p>Commander <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>. I believe it would have been essentially an uneventful
recovery. It could have been easily repaired, and I think it would have been of
little consequence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Those are my only questions, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Does anyone have any questions of the Commander? If
not, Commander, thank you very much, indeed. You have been very helpful to
us.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. From 1955 to 1958 I performed approximately 200 autopsies,
many of them pertaining to trauma including missile wounds, stationed at
Frankfurt, Germany as pathologist of the United States Army Hospital in
Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had any additional, special training or experience in
missile wounds?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. For the past 3 years I was Chief of the Wound Ballistics
Pathology Branch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and in that capacity
I reviewed personally all the cases forwarded to us by the Armed Forces,
and some civilian cases from the United States and our forces overseas. The
number of these cases amounts to approximately 400 cases. I was called as
a consultant in the field of missile wounds for this particular case, and also last
year in February 1963, the Surgeon General of the Army sent me to Vietnam
for a wound ballistics mission. I had to testify in a murder trial involving a
30/30 rifle in the first week of March this year, and I came back yesterday after
one week in Panama where I had to testify. I was sent to Panama by the
Secretary of the Army regarding the fatalities of the events of 9&ndash;10 in January
of 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been certified by the American Board of Pathology,
Doctor Finck?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I was certified in pathology anatomy by the American Board
of Pathology in 1956, and by the same American Board of Pathology in the field
of forensic pathology in 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe briefly for the Commission what forensic
pathology involves?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Forensic pathology is the study with the naked eye and with
the microscope of injuries, including missile wounds, trauma in general. In
summary, it is the part of pathology in relation to the law, violent death being
homicide, be it suicide, accidental or undetermined. It also includes unexplained
deaths, sudden deaths, and poisoning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to participate in the autopsy of the late
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you one of the three coauthors of the autopsy report
which has been previously marked and introduced into evidence here?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had occasion to conduct any experiments on the effect
of missile penetration of the brain reflected in the chart which you have brought
with you here today?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of the skull&mdash;let me phrase the question this way: What does
the test which is depicted on the document before you relate to?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. It is based on my observations, not on experiments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you pass that to me, sir, so that I may mark that as a
Commission Exhibit, and then I will ask you to identify it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. Chief Justice, may I mark as Commission Exhibit No. 400 a document?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be marked.</p>

<p>(The document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 400 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will ask Doctor Finck to describe it for us, please.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. This is a scheme which I prepared before the 22d of November.
It is a teaching scheme, but it applies to the case in discussion. It will be of
help in understanding how I could identify the entrance and the exit by examination
of bone. "A" represents the bony portion of the skull. "B" represents
the cavity of the head, the cranial cavity. "C" represents the entrance and "D"
represents the exit. The arrows indicate the missile path.</p>

<p>This scheme is based upon observation of through and through wounds of bone,
and the same differences apply to a pane of glass. The surface struck first by the
missile in relation to the surface struck next by the missile, this one, shows a
smaller diameter, which means that if you look at the route of entrance in this
case here, C, from the outside you will not see a crater. If you examine it from
the inside, you will see a crater corresponding to the bevelling, coning, shelving,
previously described by Commander Humes.</p>

<p>In the case we are discussing today, it was possible to have enough curvature
and enough portion of the crater to identify positively the wound of entrance at
the site of the bone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Relating then your evaluation of the situation with respect to
President Kennedy, and turning to Commission Exhibit No. 388, what is your
opinion as to whether point A is a wound of entrance or exit?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. My opinion as regards Exhibit 388, letter A, is that this wound
is the wound of entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what are the characteristics of that wound which lead you
to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. The characteristics were that seen from the inside of the skull,
I could see a beveling in the bone, a beveling that could not be seen when the
wound was seen from outside the skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other individual characteristics that led you to
conclude A was the wound of entrance?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present when the three pieces of scalp were reconstructed
to form the major portion of the absent part of President Kennedy's
skull which Doctor Humes described?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I was present when several portions of bone were brought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe, if anything, as to a reconstructed
hole from those three portions of skull?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. May I refer to my scheme?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Please do.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. For the sake of demonstration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. At the level of the wound of exit, E, in my scheme, Commission
Exhibit No. 400, when viewed from the inside of the skull, there was no crater,
whereas when the wound is seen from the outside of the skull, there was beveling,
cratering, or coning&mdash;this is possible to determine an exit even if only a portion
of the bone is submitted, for the reason that if there was enough bone submitted,
there is enough curvature to identify the inside and outside of the skull. Therefore
the fragment, to give you an example, this portion at the level of the wound
of exit can be oriented, and the outer surface of the skull and the inner surface
of the skull may be identified due to the curvature.</p>

<p>And then you look at the direction of the beveling and you do see the beveling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
when looking from the outside and you can identify an exit wound. And that is
what I did, and now I am referring to the actual case in discussion, Commission
Exhibit 388.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is B?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Letter B. We will see portions of bone in this general area, the
large wound in the bone on the right side of the skull of President Kennedy. I
had enough curvature to identify outside of the skull, and inside of the skull, as
the first step to orient the specimen, and then I could determine the location of
the beveling, and I could therefore say that B, Commission Exhibit 388, is a
wound of exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on your observations and conclusions, was President Kennedy
shot from the front, rear, side or what?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. President Kennedy was, in my opinion, shot from the rear.
The bullet entered in the back of the head and went out on the right side of his
skull, producing a large wound, the greatest dimension of which was approximately
13 centimeters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And as to angle, was he shot from below, from level, from above,
or what, in your opinion?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. In my opinion, the angle can be determined only approximately
due to the fact that the wound of entrance is fairly small and could give
enough precision in the determination of the path, but the dimension of the
wound of exit, letter B of Exhibit 388, is so large that we can only give an
approximate angle. In my opinion, the angle was within 45 degrees from the
horizontal plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that to say that there was a 45-degree angle of declination
from the point of origin to the point of impact, from the point of origin of the
bullet where the bullet came from a gun until the point where it struck President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. In other words, you mean was he shot from above or below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I think I can only state, sir, that he was shot from above and
behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At this time I move for admission into evidence Exhibit 400,
Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 400 for identification,
and was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to Exhibit 385, Dr. Finck, was point C a point of entry
or a point of exit, in your opinion?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. In my opinion point C of Commission's Exhibit 385 is a wound
of entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the basis for that conclusion?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. The basis for that conclusion is that this wound was relatively
small with clean edges. It was not a jagged wound, and that is what
we see in wound of entrance at a long range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present here today and did you hear the entire testimony
of Doctor Humes?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you concur in Dr. Humes' statements and opinions
regarding the point of entry C, point of exit D, and general angle on the flight
of the missile?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I certainly do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then from what direction was President Kennedy shot on entry
point C?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. From behind and above.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the bullets used dumdum bullets, in your opinion, Dr.
Finck?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. In what wound, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, start with the head wound, or the back wound, either one.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. In all the wounds considered, on the basis of the aspect of
the wound of entrance, dumdum bullets were not used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what characteristics of dumdum bullets were absent, in
your opinion&mdash;in your evaluation of these wounds?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I would expect more jagged, more irregular and larger wounds
of entrance than described in this case.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. With a dumdum bullet?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. With a dumdum bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to the question of likelihood of Governor Connally
having been wounded in the back and chest with the same bullet which passed
through President Kennedy in 385, what reduction would there be, if any, in
the velocity, considering the relative positions of the two men in the automobile
as reflected in photograph, Exhibit 398?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Of course, to reach precise figures we would need experiments
and similar circumstances with the same type ammunition at the same distance
through two human cadavers, which I did not do.</p>

<p>On the basis that if we assume that this is one bullet going through President
Kennedy's body and also through Governor Connally's body, the reduction of
velocity would be of some extent after passing through President Kennedy's
body, but not having hit bones, the reduction in velocity, after going through
President Kennedy's body, would be minimal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would there be sufficient force then to inflict the wound which
Dr. Humes described from the Parkland Hospital records as having been
inflicted on Governor Connally's back and chest?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. There would be enough energy to go through the body of the
Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In expressing your opinion on that subject, Doctor Finck, have
you taken into account the assumptions on distance, that we are dealing here
with a weapon that has a muzzle velocity in the neighborhood of slightly in
excess of 2,000, and that the vehicle carrying these two individuals was approximately
150, about 150 feet away from the site of origin of the missile?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. At this range, a bullet of this velocity loses very little velocity,
and keeps upon impact a large amount of kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You heard the whole of Doctor Humes' testimony, did you not?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything that you would like to add to what he said?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or would you like to modify his testimony in any way?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you subscribe to the observations and procedures which he
outlined during the course of his testimony?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As having been conducted on President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you share the opinions which he expressed in their
entirety in the course of his testimony here today?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You might be seated, Colonel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Just as truthful seated as standing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How many cases did you investigate to develop this
theory shown by Commission Exhibit 400?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Among the more than 400 cases I have reviewed, several of
them&mdash;I cannot give you an exact figure, I do not tabulate them, but many of
them had through and through wounds of the skull as well as of flat bones,
as, for instance, the sternum, the bone we have in front of our chest, and this
would apply also to a through and through wound of the sternum. I have cases
like that.</p>

<p>There was a specific case in which I was able to identify the entrance at the
level of the sternum on the same basis as the criteria I have given for the skull.
Whenever a bullet goes through a flat bone, it will produce that beveling, that
cratering, shelving, and that I have seen in numerous cases.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is this a generally accepted theory in the medical
profession?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes, sir; it is. Am I allowed to quote a standard textbook?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may; yes sir.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. The textbook of legal medicine, pathology and toxicology by
Gonzalez, Vance, Halpern and Umberger does not give a scheme like I have
shown to you today, but describes similar criteria.</p>

<p>As you know, one of the authors of the book I mentioned is still chief medical
examiner of New York City, with 20,000 medical-examiner cases a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor Finck, after the path C-D described in No. 385, would
that be a straight line starting with the weapon itself, or was that line deviated
in any way or altered when it passed through the body of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. For practical purposes line C-D is a straight line with little
or no deviation, the bullet not having hit bony structures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Finck, have you had an opportunity to examine Commission's
Exhibit 399?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. For the first time this afternoon, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And based upon your examination of that bullet, do you have
an opinion as to whether in its current condition it could have passed through
President Kennedy at point C-D in 385 and then inflicted the wound in the
back and chest of Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes; I do. This is a bullet showing marks indicating the
bullet was fired. The second point is that there was practically no loss of
this bullet. It kept its original caliber and dimensions. There was no evidence
that any major portion of the jacket was lost, and I consider this as one bullet
which possibly could have gone through the wounds you described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And could that bullet possibly have gone through President
Kennedy in 388?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Through President Kennedy's head? 388?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And remained intact in the way you see it now?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Definitely not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And could it have been the bullet which inflicted the wound
on Governor Connally's right wrist?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No; for the reason that there are too many fragments
described in that wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is the condition of Exhibit 399 consistent with the type
of a wound which Doctor Humes described on Governor Connally's rib?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I have a question.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. From your examination of Exhibit 399, can you identify the
caliber of that bullet?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. The caliber of this bullet, if I could measure it, but I cannot
touch it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We can.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I would say it is consistent with a 6.5 mm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Are you familiar with the Mannlicher 6.5 rifle?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I am familiar with the caliber 6.5. I can draw the calibers
for you on the blackboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What is the initial velocity of a 6.5 mm. bullet of that character?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Of the order of 2,000 feet per second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you say there would not be a substantial diminution of
that velocity either at the point of impact or at the point of exit?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. One more question, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>On 388, point A to B, what is your view, Dr. Finck, as to whether or not
that is represented by a straight line going back to the point of origin of the
weapon?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. The difficulty in interpreting the path in line A-B of Commission's
Exhibit 388 is that, one, there is, as stated before, a large wound
of exit, and, two, there is a secondary path as indicated by the fragments
recovered. So we can have an assumption and state that the general direction,
the general path, the general angle of this missile was from behind and above,
and that the bullet, markedly fragmented, went out of the President's head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
on the right side, but that a portion of this bullet which badly fragmented was
recovered within the skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In view of the impact on the skull at point A, it is unlikely to
be a straight line to B all the way back to the muzzle of the weapon as it is,
say, in 385 C-D, all the way back to the muzzle of the gun.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. In C-D, Commission's Exhibit 385, due to the fact that there
was no fragmentation, I can say that it is a straight line from behind and
above, whereas here, due to the fragmentation and to the dual path, I can't
give a precise angle, but I can say that the injury is consistent with a wound
produced by one bullet producing many fragments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator, have you any questions you want to ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask one?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes; go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you examine any of the fragments which were removed
from the President's skull?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I only saw one fragment shown to me when I arrived
at Bethesda, and it was an elongated black metallic fragment, and that is the
only one I saw to my recollection. I was told that it had been removed from
the brain of President Kennedy in the anterior portion of his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. From that bullet, that fragment, could you determine, was it
sufficiently large to determine from the ballistic evidence the caliber of the
bullet?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No, sir; for the reason that to determine the caliber you need
the entire bullet, or at least an entire portion. You need a portion of the bullet
showing the entire diameter, and I was not shown that. I was shown a fragment
which represented a very small portion of the original bullet. Therefore, at that
time I could not say anything on the possible original caliber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You examined no fragment which did contain those characteristics?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No, sir; I did not see any entire bullet or bullet showing the
entire diameter.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I believe you testified, Colonel, that you concurred in the
previous testimony by Commander Humes and Commander Boswell, and that
you were one of the co-authors of the autopsy. At any time during this process
where you were conducting the autopsy, was there any disagreement between
any one of you three, any difference of opinion as to anything involved in the
autopsy?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There has been complete unanimity on what you saw,
what you did, and what you have reported?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator Cooper?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Colonel, I would like for you to look at Exhibit 388 and at the
possible trajectory of the bullet which entered President Kennedy's head at A
and then mark it as a possible point of exit by "out". You remember there was
testimony about a portion of the bullet from point A to the place on the diagram
marked "fragment" where a fragment was found. I would like to ask if it is
possible that the trajectory of the bullet, from the point of origin, could have
been A to this point marked "fragment" as well as from A to the place marked
"out"?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I don't think so, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Why? Would you explain that answer?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. I would think that I would consider the midportion of this
exit would labeled B, Exhibit 388, as the wound produced by most of the
fragments and the major portions of the fragmenting bullet. This is only a small
portion of it which makes me say that this is a secondary path.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was the size of the fragment relative to the size of the
missile of the 6.5 Mannlicher, fired from the 6.5 Mannlicher rifle?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Approximately one-tenth, or even less.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From your numerous case studies, is it typical for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
bullet, for a missile in this circumstance as shown in 388, to fragment to the
degree that this one apparently did?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes, it is quite common to find a wound of exit much larger
than the wound of entrance for weapons commonly used.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But is it typical for the missile to fragment to the degree
that this one did as shown in Exhibit 388?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is it typical to find only a limited number of fragments
as you apparently did in this case?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. This depends to a great extent on the type of ammunition used.
There are many types of bullets, jacketed, not-jacketed, pointed, hollow-nosed,
hollow-points, flat-nose, round-nose, all these different shapes will have a different
influence on the pattern of the wound and the degree of fragmentation.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you, Colonel, very much for your help.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. You are welcome, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask just one question?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes; Colonel, we would like to ask just one more question.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do these two wounds represent the same or a different
kind of bullet?</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. You are referring to one wound and this other wound here?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I am referring to the wound shown in Exhibit 388 identified
as point of entry A, and wound in Exhibit 385 identified as C.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Due to the difference in the nature of the tissue, difference in
the nature of the target, it is perfectly possible that these two wounds came
from the same type of bullet, that one hit bony structures and the other one did
not, and that explains the differences between the patterns of these two wounds.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Why one fragmented and one did not.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Finck</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, again thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="mrp">TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL R. PAINE</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine, I will just read a brief statement concerning the purpose of the
meeting today which is our practice.</p>

<p>The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Michael R.
Paine. The Commission has been advised that Mr. and Mrs. Paine made the
acquaintance of the Oswalds during 1963, and that Mrs. Marina Oswald lived
in the Paine home from late September 1963 up to the time of the assassination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Since the Commission is inquiring fully into the background and possible
motive of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin, it intends to ask the above
witnesses questions concerning Mr. Oswald, his associations and relations with
others, as well as questions concerning any and all matters relating to the
assassination.</p>

<p>You have been furnished a copy of this, have you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have seen something to that effect.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You have seen it.</p>

<p>Very well, will you rise and raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission will
be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be seated; Mr. Liebeler will propound the questions
to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Michael R. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 2515 West Fifth Street, Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born, Mr. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. June 25, 1928.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly your educational background, where
you attended schools?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I went to school, high school in New York, went to 2 years of
Harvard and a year of Swarthmore, I have not finished college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What class would you have been in Swarthmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You would have been 1953 if you finished or did you finish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are presently married, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your wife's name is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ruth Hyde Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have two children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us who your parents are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lyman Paine is my father and Ruth Forbes Paine Young, or
Young is her present name. Mrs. Arthur Young now. She is my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where is your father living at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He is in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a brother in Baltimore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Cameron Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By whom are you presently employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Bell Helicopter, Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have a security clearance in connection with your work
at Bell Helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose it is. I don't happen to know what the classification is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you work prior to working for Bell Helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I worked in Pennsylvania for Arthur Young.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the nature of your employment with Mr. Young?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had set up a shop in his barn and started work for myself and
then he employed me making models, helicopter models for himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately at what time, what period of time did you
work for Mr. Young?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is very difficult to say. I began more or less gradually first.
I was doing other things. I am very vague about the dates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know the year approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose I went to work at Bell in 1958. I have been there 4½
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is this Mr. Young your stepfather?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you worked for him immediately prior to your going to
Bell Helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Prior to working for Mr. Young, did you have any other
employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I came from the Army. Before that I worked at Bartol
Research Foundation in Swarthmore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were going to tell us what that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was mostly a job of setting up a laboratory to&mdash;was nuclear
research laboratory, Van Der Graaf generators it had there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the nature of your work with Bartol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mostly all the work in making those machines, setting those machines
so they would run; making counters, coincidence counters, instrumentation
to operate the machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you work for Bartol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was just about a year, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Prior to that did you have any other employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, that was Swarthmore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever work for the Griswold Manufacturing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I did; yes. That was after&mdash;well, after the Army. I think
it was only a few months, I don't remember when it fitted in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the nature of your work with that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was very boring. It was engraving precision scales.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You worked in the actual engraving of the scales?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the nature of your work with Bell Helicopter at the
present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am called a research engineer. I work in a lab and design and
build and test models of new concepts of helicopter configurations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been engaged in that type of work for Bell throughout
the entire time you have been employed by them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have been in the research laboratory research group that long.
It has all been <span class="locked">problems&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are you a helicopter pilot by any chance yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am an airplane pilot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But your work basically for Bell has been in the research of
design and operation of helicopters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us the circumstances under which you met your
wife and subsequently married her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met her at a folk dance party, folk dance meeting, and I had
known her for about 2 years before we married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you meet her approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We were married, I think, in 1958, it was the end of the year so
maybe it was 1957. What was the question again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately when you met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two years before that would be, 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 1956 or 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We understand that you are a Quaker, Mr. Paine, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is not quite correct.</p>

<p>When I was in Philadelphia, I sang in various churches, and Ruth being a
Quaker, started going to Quaker meetings. Had I remained there I would have
become a Quaker. Moving to Texas there was a very small Quaker community,
and I joined the Unitarian Church after a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you first become interested in the Quaker religion;
was it about the time you met your wife or was it before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I think she was instrumental in bringing me into that circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Give us a brief description of the outside interests that you
and your wife and that your wife had during the time subsequent to your
meeting and until the time you left Philadelphia. Was she active in church
activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I wouldn't say so. She was active in the Young Friends
Committee of North America which was making an effort to bring a group of
Russians on tour of this country. It was in the first flush or enthusiasm of
East-West contacts, and after a couple of years they did succeed in bringing
those Russians on tour. That was the beginning of her interest in Russian,
learning the Russian language. I think that was her only activity that I am
aware of or remember right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether your wife engaged in a writing campaign
or a pen pal campaign between people in the United States and people in the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was another part of this East-West contacts committee's
duties or tasks they took upon themselves and I think she was chairman, accepted
the chairmanship of that committee.</p>

<p>For a while, it was almost moribund, very inactive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Which committee was that, the committee to stimulate letters
between Russia and the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; to find names and addresses on each side to connect people
together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you yourself ever take part in any activity of that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You spoke of the East-West contacts committee as being active
in trying to bring a group of Russians to the United States. Did they engage
in any activities other than this attempt to bring Russians to the United States
that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the only one I know of, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they succeed in bringing some Russians to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they did. They brought three Russians, and then the Russians
reciprocated by taking a group of Quakers who knew Russian on a tour of
Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you married to Ruth Hyde Paine at the time these Russian
people came to the United States under the auspices of the East-West
contacts committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might have been; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether she actively participated in the program
to bring the Russians to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she participated insofar as going to the meetings. I don't
believe she did most of the writing to the State Department and what-not to
try to arrange clearances and itineraries and things like that, but she was at
the meetings at which those things were discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she ever discuss them with you in any detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We, I would often&mdash;I went to several of those meetings myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know the names of any of the Russians who came to the
United States in connection with this program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might recognize them if I saw them again, but right now the
names have escaped me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say there were just three of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think there were three; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you a member of the American Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you become a member of that organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose you become a member as soon as you contribute money,
and I may have contributed money a good many years back. I didn't start going
to a meeting of the organization until I was&mdash;I have only been to about four
perhaps, in Dallas, four meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is Dallas the only place you have attended meetings of the
ACLU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you acquainted with an organization known as the Friends
Peace Committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a familiar name. I guess not, though. I don't think I have
been to a meeting of theirs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know if it is connected in any way with the Young
Friends Committee of North America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I take it to be a Friend, you know, a Quaker committee but I
believe it is connected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know a gentleman by the name of Dennis Jamison,
who I believe is active in the Friends Peace Committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or George Lakey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For practical purposes; no. The names seem a little familiar but
I can't place them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of the connection in which it is
familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you familiar with the Committee for
Non-Violent Action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Many of these things sound familiar. I don't&mdash;I really am saying
no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you a member or have you ever attended any meetings of
the John Birch Society?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not a member. I have been to one or, I guess chiefly one
meeting of theirs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the night Stevenson spoke in Dallas.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The night Stevenson spoke in Dallas, U.N. Day.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was that 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us the circumstances of your attendance at
that meeting and what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had been seeking to go to a Birch meeting for some time, and
then I was invited on this night so I went. It was an introductory meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. On the 9th of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was November something, I don't know what, a Wednesday
or Thursday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For the record I think the record should indicate that Mr.
Stevenson was in Dallas on or about October 24, 1963. Who invited you to
this meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had tried once before to go to a meeting which didn't occur.
There happens to be a member of our choir, a paid soloist who is a John Birch
advocate so I have been applying&mdash;so I have been telling her, that I wanted
to go. I suppose, I don't remember for certain but I suppose she was the one
who told me where and when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did this meeting have anything to do with the activity that
occurred at Mr. Stevenson's meeting in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. You see they were taking place at the same time. It was
rather sparsely attended, most of them were down spitting on Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Birch meeting which you were down to was sparsely
attended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this an evening meeting or afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is evening.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask, did you go out of curiosity rather than sympathy or
rather how did you happen to go?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not in sympathy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So I gathered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have been to a number of rightist meetings and seminars in
Texas. I was interested in seeing more communication between the right and
the left; there isn't much liberal out there and so I wanted to be able to speak
their language and know that their fears&mdash;and be familiar with their feelings
and attitudes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any discussion at this meeting as far as you can
recall of Mr. Stevenson's appearance in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't believe there was any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any discussion of the policy of the Kennedy administration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no discussion at that meeting. It was a 2- or 3-hour
lecture on a movie by Welch, and then a young man gave a few more explanations
about the organization. It was mostly an introductory meeting. I think
for newcomers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Telling them about the John Birch Society itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Welch was not there, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this a movie in which he participated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was the speaker at a lectern in this movie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any knowledge of the political attitudes or activities
of your father, George Lyman Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have very little specific knowledge of what he does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us what you do know about your father's political
activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have seen my father rather rarely. Since I have been in Texas,
I have seen him more frequently. I think I have been out there three times
now in the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say out there&mdash;you mean Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have seen him twice. He was out to Texas. I have been
to Los Angeles twice, and he came at least once to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Please fix the time when you went to Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Last summer, 2 weeks in August or something. I was there for
3 days, the first, the middle of August.</p>

<p>I would guess it was about 2 years before that that I had been there. I
could be off by a year both ways. I can't even remember whether he came&mdash;I
think he probably interspersed his visit between mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall that he visited Irving on two different occasions,
once in Christmas, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One was a Christmas party, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And once in the summer of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember '61. I do remember pictures now, we have
pictures showing us outside so that was balmy weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that in the period that you have been living in Texas you
have gone to Los Angeles on two different occasions and visited your father
there and he has been in Irving on two different occasions, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That seems, I think, to be right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you go on and tell us what you know about your
father's political activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Well, we would have to go back to a little to when I lived in New York as
a school student in school, grammar school and high school. There I would
see him very infrequently considering our close proximity and the fact that I
found him stimulating and I liked him.</p>

<p>He took me to a few, one or possibly two, Communist meetings at my considerable
insistence. He didn't urge this upon me. I wanted to go, to get
the feeling of the&mdash;I asked him what he did or something and I wanted to know
all this, my mother said he was on the radical left.</p>

<p>So, I went to a few of those meetings, and didn't&mdash;was unfamiliar with the
issues and questions they were debating. I got the feeling, I came away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
the impression, that these people, there were three Communist groups apparently
in New York at the time, and they were most up in arms with each other,
or <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Excuse me, how old were you at this time approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was somewhere from eighth grade to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What year about, what time span would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well 1947, I think I got out of high school, so it is 1943 to 1947.</p>

<p>Then I didn't&mdash;I got the flavor of those meetings. I found sort of an intense
people, people of high intensity. I didn't feel very much at home there, and
I guess I didn't go to any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did they try to recruit you at all or to get you to be a member
or attend or join meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; they were glad to meet Lyman's son. That is he would introduce
me to friends or people he knew there, and I liked&mdash;I had some favorable
attitudes to the zeal of the group or the zeal of the assembled people.</p>

<p>They were fully committed to what they believed in. I had my own dreams of
how I would like to see society at the time and it wasn't along the same line.</p>

<p>So, I felt happy to have them there and I would go my course and just&mdash;I
didn't feel opposed to them; neither did I feel drawn to them, although I tried
to read some of Das Kapital at that time and Communist manifesto.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever join any of these organizations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I didn't know of any organization as such.</p>

<p>I went to this meeting in downtown New York. I didn't know&mdash;so therefore
I knew three groups. Maybe it was the Socialist group and the Stalinist group
and I think the group that Lyman was in, I don't know, maybe he was a
Socialist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which was the second group, was it the Stalinist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I mentioned the Stalinist, Dubinsky, David Dubinsky, was the
only name I remember aside from Stalin, was a name I remember there, and I
can't now remember whose side who was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any clear recollection of what particular group
your father was associated with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I never had&mdash;never knew what the name of any group he
might be associated with.</p>

<p>Now, I suppose it was Trotsky. Trotskyite was a different distinct group at
that time. They probably wouldn't be mentioning their own group. They
would be mentioning their opponent's group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Subsequent to your attendance at the meetings of these groups
at the time you have spoken of did you ever attend any other meetings of
similar groups either in New York or any other place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't remember anything of a similar nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know of your father ever using any aliases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are not familiar with the name Thomas L. Brown or
Lyman Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was aware that my father didn't talk readily about his affairs.
When we met we would talk at great length and we always do talk. There is
an amazing similarity in our natures. I have almost thought there was one
person trying to live in two bodies.</p>

<p>But we have always been completely absorbed in subjects that were closer to
my&mdash;without going into what he was doing day to day or what he was&mdash;I was
aware that I didn't know, and I didn't pry or probe as to what he might be
doing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So far as you know, however, he was actively participating in
the meetings and activities of this group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I correct in understanding that your father and mother
were divorced when you were about 4 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were at that time living in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Subsequently you and your mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She got a divorce in Reno, Nev., she had a house in Virginia City.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. In New York you were living with your father or mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They lived together in New York. Then there was a year, a part
of a year, we moved to Philadelphia. They may have separated and he tried
to come back or something like that, and then we went to Reno, Nev.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time you lived in Philadelphia, was your father
living with the family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he was there part time. I don't remember that for sure.
We had two houses there. One I think I remember him slightly and the other
one I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your father was not present during the time that you stayed
in Nevada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You and your brother stayed in Nevada with your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And a housekeeper also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you left Nevada where did you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We went over to California. Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who lived there at that time with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A friend of hers, Kathleen, now she was originally Kathleen
Schroeder, a sister of my uncle, now Kathleen Forbes, and a distant cousin
of my mother's, and I think my grandfather, grandparents, would come out
occasionally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was your father present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He wasn't there at any time during your stay in Santa Barbara?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember that. I am not certain of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you live in Santa Barbara, Calif.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Each year my grandfather paid our way back across the country
to Naushon Island in Massachusetts. We lived there 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you go after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Cambridge, Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From the third to the sixth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With whom did you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With my mother on Fairweather Street.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Is this of particular importance to the investigation, it is
very lengthy, and I don't know particularly what it bears upon. If it is in
relation with his father, let's get at that and get it over with, but I don't see
what this man's history from the time he was born&mdash;I don't see how it bears
on it. It just takes altogether too much time for an extraneous purpose, it
seems to me. Let's get on with the thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It bears on the point only on what connection he has with his
father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Let me go to that. I have seen him on a few times, once a year
would be a frequent&mdash;we felt great affinity in our bent, not in the actual application
of the way we would like to do things but in a concern for the value of
people. I know very little about what he does, and he has not tried to proselytize
me, and he has not volunteered information about what he did.</p>

<p>I think a certain change has come over him since. For many years or years in
college or something I thought he was still interested in his revolutionary
groups and that was a pity because that wasn't going to happen, and it was to
be a dead end, a blind, he would come to the end of his life and his cause had
fizzled out.</p>

<p>When I went out to California more recently, the last time we were talking
about the civil rights movement and, shall we say, the revolution occurring in
this country spearheaded by the Negroes' demand for dignity, that was a subject
that completely absorbed the weekend and there were various Negroes
who came around the country, who happened to pass through at that time.</p>

<p>You probably might be interested in regard to Cuba. I was surprised sometime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
in the conversation someone there had spoken favorably of the revolution
in Cuba. This was a surprise to me, I didn't realize that this was part of
the&mdash;was the present thrill, shall we say. I don't know whether that applied
to Lyman also or whether&mdash;I think he went along with that. We didn't
get around to arguing on that point. I only mention that in passing. That was
about the full extent of it.</p>

<p>She mentioned Cuba in this favorable way, and it was a subject I <span class="locked">didn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who was this she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was Grace somebody, I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. One of the people present in these conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. So that was my only knowledge that he was, or the people
around him were, interested in Cuba, and that is the only thing I can see has
any bearing in your interest here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To what extent would you say that your father has influenced
your own political views and attitudes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would have guessed it was almost negligible. I was aware that
sometime in the beginning of college or something I used the language of
the masses or I used jargon which I recognized, came to perceive was of quite
leftist nature, and I think that at the time I used to get The Nation, that was
in high school. I probably picked it up more from the magazines and things
of that sort than from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss your father with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On a phone call shortly after the assassination he called and
thought it was outrageous to be pinning Lee Oswald who was a scapegoat, an
ideal person to hang the blame on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your father called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he called me, yes. He didn't suppose it was true, I told
him I thought it probably was true. And I told him to keep his shirt on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything else about that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. It was chiefly both he and Freddy, his wife, had to be
calmed down. They thought it was a steamrollered job of injustice or something.
And I didn't think their admonitions were&mdash;I think not to say anything,
not to join the hubbub or jump on the things I said or I took it to be things I
said would be distorted and blown up and added to the hullabaloo to lynch Lee.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did they infer or imply that the allegations or accusations
against Oswald bore the semblance of a lynching? And I use lynching in
the broad sense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They did not use lynching at all. I added that. They thought
he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Being railroaded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he said that no one, no member of the Friends of Cuba would
want to assassinate the President. That was a crazy idea.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You said that was a crazy idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he said that. Therefore, he concluded, and this was the same,
similar to my feeling, that I first didn't think Oswald had done it because I
didn't see how it fitted in, how it helped his favorite ideals.</p>

<p>And Lyman then said the same thing. Therefore, including himself, Lyman,
that Lee couldn't have done it, and that this must be&mdash;Lee was the ideal person
to hang it on.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How soon was this phone call after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was&mdash;he did not know, I think, that we had Marina
staying with us, but he was one of the first to connect, guess that it was us. He
called and asked us, "Is this you?"</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. "Is this you?" What? I don't quite understand the
context here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He heard it on the news and he heard Mrs. Paine, and Marina had
been staying with a Mrs. Paine and he called to ask, "Are you the Paines?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had you discussed Lee Oswald with your father prior to this
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think I mentioned him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether your father knew Lee Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I do not know. Or I gather since he had such a funny idea of
him over the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your judgment the only way your father heard
of Lee Oswald, connected Lee Oswald to you, was through a news broadcast that
he had heard connecting Oswald with somebody named Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or Marina had stayed with the Paines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss your father with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And Oswald never asked you about your father in any way or
did he indicate that he knew of your father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not. I think Ruth came closer to revealing that my
father had&mdash;you will have to ask her about that question. I did not mention
my father to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you meet Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met him sometime in the spring of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This is Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We were invited to a party, Ruth and I were invited to a party,
given by Everett Glover. I had a cold and wasn't able to go. Ruth went at
that time and subsequently went once or twice to see Marina. And she invited
Marina and Lee to our house for dinner, and here the date that comes to mind
is April 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where was Marina staying at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Berry Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Berry Street in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Berry Street or would it be Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Neely Street. So this was the first time I saw them. I had to
go over, he didn't drive a car and I had to go over, and pick him up in my car
and bring him back to the house. So I went over to Neely Street and saw them.
Marina took about half an hour to pack all the things for Junie. Meanwhile I
was talking to Lee at their house there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us about that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I asked him what he was doing, his job, and he showed me a
picture on the wall, which was a piece of newspaper, I think&mdash;that is beside
the point. I asked him about Russia, what he liked <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we get that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was beside the point. It was a piece of newspaper
showing a fashion ad, I think. I think his job <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Nothing to do with politics at all, to do with his job. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I asked him what he thought. I wanted to know why he had
gone to Russia and why he had then come back. He had told me he had become
a Marxist in this country without ever having met a Communist, by reading
books and then he got to Russia, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he went to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said he wanted to go to Russia. He had chosen to go to
Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't elaborate on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I gathered he had had an interest in going to Russia for a
number of years prior to the time he got there and decided that that was the
paradise of the world and through fortunate relations between this country
and Russia at the time, I would have to remember history to know whether
that was a warm, a friendly time or not, but he indicated both his going and his
coming were fortunate times in history or something that made it possible for
him to do these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Fortunate times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Fortunate times, this was sort of an accident in history. This
is what I gathered from his conversation.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Fortunate that he could leave at the time and fortunate
that he could come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Fortunate that he could be accepted to emigrate to Russia. He
told me that he had&mdash;so he went to Russia and he tried to surrender his passport
to the Russians but the State Department would not give it to him, or the consul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
in Moscow, which was&mdash;which proved to be fortunate because then a few years
later when he wanted to return it would not have been possible, except if they
still had his passport. He had not legally surrendered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that was a fortunate circumstance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he smiled, he indicated to me he genuinely had wanted
to become a Russian citizen and to surrender it. He wanted to renounce his
American citizenship. He tried to, and the Russians, he told me, had accepted
his bona fide intentions and tried to get the passport away from the Americans.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was the failure to get his passport a determining factor
in their not accepting his desires?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. He told me that they did accept his desires despite his inability
to get the passport and give it to them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Despite his inability?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. "They" being the Russians?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they being the Russians and they issued to him, he told me,
the standard kind of temporary citizenship paper which is given to all emigres
to Russia, and there are <span class="locked">some&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was it citizenship paper he said or something else, citizenship
paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now, I suppose there was a regular paper and everybody would
know of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Domicile paper or something allowing domicile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had thought, my impression was, that it was kind of probationary
citizenship. It is a kind of paper issued for a year to somebody who is seeking
citizenship. That was my impression at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could it have been a probationary residence permit or something
of that sort. He said citizenship, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was my impression. That it was the commencement of a
citizenship paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he tell you about any difficulties he had in getting permission
to stay on in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, this was a question. I asked him how was it they so
readily accepted&mdash;you know other Americans have a hard time staying more
than 30 days there, "How was it that you were so readily accepted into the
bosom of Soviet Society?" And to that he answered, "well, it was just a fortunate
mood between the countries or something to that effect," is something that
I gathered.</p>

<p>I didn't remember the history and I thought it would be&mdash;he smiled a little
bit. I can't remember whether he smiled a little bit when I then asked him how
did he manage to get out, at one time, but at one time I do remember he smiled
as though there were a story there, and I didn't&mdash;I supposed the story would be
too intricate, not interesting enough to try to get him to relate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not ask him to relate the story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever learn the circumstances under which he left
Russia, from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As he told me at that same half hour before we came back to our
house on Fifth <span class="locked">Street,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this the first time you had seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All this happened in the first half hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The first time you had ever seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The first time I had seen him or at least that first night.</p>

<p>He told me he had decided, that he had wanted, to come back to this country
and it was through the fortunate circumstance of the Embassy still having his
passport which was a legal loophole that made it legally possible, and I asked
him&mdash;at sometime I thought this was rather nice that the State Department, I
think this was a little later in the same evening, the State Department had forewarned
him, had granted him money also, to come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He told me that and I was rather proud of the State Department
for its generous behavior toward such a wayward citizen. He actually had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
spoken&mdash;I had mentioned this because he had spoken abusively of the American
Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At this time, during the first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not just the American Government&mdash;yes; at this same meeting.
He had spoken with abuse of, sort of resentment that they didn't let him have
his passport and I thought, well now, that was just kind of a nice trick, by
having a consular official there that he knew, this man wanted to change his
mind, this little legal dodge of not wanting to give him his passport which I
think is illegal if the man wants it, it would be the thing to permit him to
come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you point that out to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think he responded to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He talked about surrendering the passport rather than surrendering
citizenship, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The two were synonymous, I thought, that if you surrendered your
passport and with the intention of adopting another one that was renouncing
American citizenship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which he wanted, he told me he wanted to renounce his American
citizenship. He said that quite flatly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything else about this conversation concerning
his trip back and his attitude toward the State Department and the
United States that he discussed during this first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so. I think I have got it a little confused with
Marguerite Oswald what she said at the assassination, at the time of the night
of the 22d. She was resentful of the State Department, thinking it had been
remiss in taking so long in getting him back. I don't remember whether he
had voiced the same&mdash;I am confused, I don't know whether it was he or she who
had voiced this resentment. I thought to the contrary it was very generous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether or not Oswald himself voiced resentment
against the Government of the United States in this connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do remember that. That was the thing that prompted me
to say that it was actually rather nice of them to have been illegal just for
<span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I didn't catch the last. Nice of them to have been what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought it probably was illegal of the embassy official not to
hand over his passport when he demanded it in order to surrender it to the
Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you don't remember Oswald responding to that when you
made that answer to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember his response.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You also said you thought it was rather nice of the State
Department to do that in order to make it possible for him to return if he
wanted to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I said both of these things. They had given him money.
They had held, a peccadillo to hold, the passport out of the knowledge that he
might, such people might, want to return, change their mind, and then to
provide him money moreover to come back, this all seemed to me rather nice
even though it had taken 2 more months than when he originally wanted to
come back.</p>

<p>I had said, this in response to his, some kind of expression on his part of
criticism of the State Department or the foreign embassy or whatever it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember why he was critical? Was he critical because
they had not given him his passport when he went to Russia or was he critical
because in his opinion they had taken so long to arrange his return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he was critical when he first mentioned it, he seemed to
have the critical attitude&mdash;some of this critical attitude may have been facial
expressions or way of speaking, which was somewhat common with him. Therefore,
I can't remember for sure whether it was in the words or in his attitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
He was critical, though, certainly of the first, of the State Department not
relinquishing his passport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was he critical at this latter time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was critical of that as he was relating to his desire to go to
the Soviet Union. He was relating the story to me, and then he had spoken of
the State Department as though they were a bunch of bastards, wouldn't&mdash;or
illegal or something. Anyway, he was unfavorable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But did you indicate he was rather glad that they had later
taken this position so that he could get his passport back or did I misunderstand
you on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I pointed out to him that or said "it was kind of fortunate
that they had held your passport," and I think he nodded his assent to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he decided to return to the United States
from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Most of this conversation, I think, was when we had first met
and I wasn't sure whether he was speaking derogatively of the Soviet Union in
order to win my good graces or thinking he could win my friendship that way.</p>

<p>However, he spoke more with disfavor of the Soviet Union during this first
meeting than was quite comprehensible to someone who had gone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But chiefly what he said was that he didn't have choice of where
he could live, you were assigned, he spoke with a certain amount of derision,
scorn of the fact that you were assigned jobs, and he thought the food was
boring, I think, to use his word. He had mentioned that he liked to&mdash;he had
gone hunting with some friends, that was the only thing he mentioned about
the Soviet Union in which I sensed that he had been with people except for
also mentioning that he had been the center of interest as an American who
couldn't drive a car.</p>

<p>But apparently he had relished going hunting. He had also said with resentment,
a Soviet citizen could not own a rifle. They could own shotguns but
not a rifle, and that you could shoot a rifle only by joining a rifle club which
he said was a paramilitary organization.</p>

<p>Again, this was with a degree of scorn in his voice or his attitude. I had
assumed that he at least tried the paramilitary organization, the rifle club,
so he could speak with such scorn, with knowledge of what he was speaking
about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he had joined an organization in which
he was permitted to shoot a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not. I don't know that for a fact. I had assumed
from his conversation that he had tried it but I gather that he did not like
this organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he say anything about having to leave the rifle at the club,
that you couldn't take the rifle away from the club, or anything of that kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I assume that was true. He didn't mention it, he mentioned
that a Soviet citizen could not possess a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he speak of any training that he might have received in
connection with either a rifle or a shotgun while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you the degree of facility with which he used
either of these weapons while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He&mdash;is there anything else he told you about this hunting club
or this rifle or shotgun that you can remember now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am not particularly interested in rifles and hunting so that
I didn't&mdash;it was an ideal opportunity&mdash;I think he did love hunting so I think
it would have been an ideal way to reach him in a somewhat human way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You got no idea of how much time he was at the rifle club or
what? Did it seem to be a frequent occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I can't say I had any fruitful idea of whether he was a
member of it. I assumed he was a member of it. He didn't say he was a member
of it. I assumed he spoke with authority saying it was a paramilitary organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
and somehow conveying the idea that he didn't like that aspect of it and,
therefore, I assumed he didn't like it. He spoke only with pleasure of his
hunting trip. He mentioned a hunting trip, I don't think he mentioned them
in plural, which he had taken with some friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any more details about that hunting trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We talked, this was within the first half hour, the talk was very
brief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention to you this hunting trip or anything relating
to a rifle or shotgun in the Soviet Union at any later time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't know what time he was referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I mean at any other time after the first meeting with you did
he refer again to his activities in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In connection with this rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that subject never came up again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you at this first meeting about his work in the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had gathered he worked somewhere in a television factory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I can't remember whether it was television, it was electronics
of some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you the nature of his work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not tell me. I thought to myself that if he was in a very
honorable position there he would have mentioned it. So, I thought he was
probably just a mechanic of some sort, wiring it together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much he was paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't remember, I think he did but I don't remember what he
said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that he received any income other than from
his work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't believe he told me anything about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have been referring primarily here in our questioning to
the first meeting that you had with him, but do you remember any subsequent
conversation with Oswald about his work, his pay, and his income in the Soviet
Union after this first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he thought it was too low. He thought the standard of
living, he recognized the standard of living was low, and they were restricted
therefore in their&mdash;just too confined, told where to live. The food was boring
and there was nothing to do. I didn't get the idea it was lack of money. He
did not say anything about lack of money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if we could get for our guidance the approximate number
of times he saw Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was about four times that we had lengthy conversations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Four times, that is four times prior to the date of the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or that includes all the times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't see him again after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't see him after the assassination. Four times prior to
the assassination including this one time you have already described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. This is the first meeting before he went to New Orleans
and then about three weekends after he came <span class="locked">back&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think that will be taken up. I just wanted to get in my mind
approximately how many times in all you saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald at any time indicate to you that he was treated by
the Russian authorities in any way different from ordinary Russian citizens
who occupied a similar status in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I wasn't aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about any special training that he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he mention his living accommodations?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, with some kind of resentment he did, that it was assigned,
and I think that is about all he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask whether these questions relate to all the four times
or just to the first time, are we still on the first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Basically on the first time, sir, unless we specify to the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us what else you and Oswald discussed during this first
meeting that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Unfortunately that first meeting was the clearest one. I was
asking him questions, taking his answers. I had hoped when I met this man
to have insights into Russia, both meeting him and meeting his wife, and
interesting talks about the differences between the Russian system and the
American, the western system.</p>

<p>Then I found that he was&mdash;some questions, later in the evening, the conversation
was translated into Russian also so that Marina could follow along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You mean after the first half hour when you were <span class="locked">preparing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right, when we came back after dinner to our house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Your house. So this went on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What you have heard now occurred mostly in the first half hour
when I was speaking directly to him when I met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then you returned to Irving to your house and had dinner and
had the additional conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Now, in all the subsequent conversations, you are going
to get less information in what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In the first part of this meeting you were alone and in the second
part of the meeting there were other people there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My wife and Marina was able to join us. At this time Marina was
packing things for Junie and I noticed that he was speaking very harshly to
her. He was telling her what bag or satchel to take. I gathered from it, of
course, it was in Russian, and I thought to myself, here is a little fellow who
certainly insists on wearing the pants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You don't understand Russian yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. So he spoke loudly to her, and didn't rise from his seat.
But spoke surprisingly harshly especially in front of a guest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did she take this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With a bit of umbrage. She didn't like it. It rankled her.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, this half hour conversation took place
in their apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. While she was packing the bags to go to your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was she packing the bags for some days or was <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; just bottles, diapers, clothing, something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. For a weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just for the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just for an evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know why it took so long but it did. I guess they weren't
quite ready when I arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What else did you and Oswald speak about during this evening,
do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After supper the conversation was translated into Russian, and I
wanted to gather Marina's or get Marina's corroboration of certain things he
said about Russia and there we found when she had differing opinions from
him that he would not let her, he would slap her down verbally, and not let her
express them or say&mdash;Ruth told me later, he was calling her a fool, "You don't
know anything."</p>

<p>When I encountered this, I actually trusted Marina to know&mdash;the questions
I was asking, it seemed to me could be better answered by Marina, so I wasn't
paying very close attention to what he had said about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you indicate on what points they seemed to differ or what
points that he raised that irritated her or vice versa in their discussion about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Russia? You said he slapped her down. I was wondering on what kind of
points he slapped her down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have unfortunately tried to remember those points myself wishing,
wondering whether hypnosis would bring it out of me as a tape recorder,
or something. I was interested to know whether the Russians were happy with
their system, whether they felt the presence of the Secret Police, these are
questions, I don't remember asking them, these are questions that I would have
been interested in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any response either from Marina or from
Oswald on these points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I don't remember anything specific here. I just remember
that I encountered too many points, where they apparently differed and, therefore,
I had in mind I will just wait until she can learn English and we will get
it from the horse's mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you speak with Oswald during this first meeting of the
circumstances under which he met Marina and married her in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember when I learned that. I think I learned it from
Ruth, who had spoken to Marina on this subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you learn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It may have been&mdash;I don't remember when it occurred, it may have
been after the assassination, I may have read it in the paper or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember any specific conversations with Oswald
on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Lee Oswald ever speak to you about his experience in the
United States Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He mentioned that his brother went in the Marine Corps and
apparently enjoyed it and he had then, I think he said he had left school early
to join it and I gathered, I thought to myself, he is expecting to find the joy
his brother found there and he did not find it. He did not like the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you anything&mdash;pardon me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not mention that I can recall his exit from the Marine
Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention the name of Governor Connally in connection
with his experiences in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he ever mention the President in this or any other
conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He mentioned the President only once that I can remember
specifically; at the ACLU meeting I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At the which?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the ACLU meeting I took him to. He had mentioned, he
thought President Kennedy was doing quite a good job in civil rights, which
was high praise coming from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussion during this first meeting other
than the discussion you have already mentioned concerning Oswald's political
beliefs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There, of course, I was interested in that subject, found we
differed, and then in order to not wrestle with concepts or arguments that were
unmanageably large, I tried to bring it down to more specific instances of how
he would like to see the world be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you become aware of the fact that you differed, do
you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember him making any bones about it the very first
meeting. He told me he had become a Marxist, in his own apartment there,
that he had become a Marxist by reading books and never having met a
Communist in this country.</p>

<p>And he also then told me with a certain sadness or regret that he couldn't
speak about political and economic subjects with his people, and fellows at
work.</p>

<p>(At this point Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were going to mention specific areas of political discussion
that you had with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One other thing happened in this first half hour, the most fruitful
half hour I had ever had with him. He had mentioned his employer. I probably
asked him why did he leave this country to go to the Soviet Union, and
his supreme theme in this regard is the exploitation of man by man, by which
he means one man making a profit out of another man's labor, which is the
normal employment situation in this country and to which he found&mdash;took,
felt great resentment.</p>

<p>He was aware that his employer made&mdash;he made more money for his employer
than he was paid and specifically he mentioned how his employer of
the engraving company goods and chattels that he had, that Oswald didn't
have, and with some specific resentment toward this employer, and I thought
privately to myself that this resentment must show through if he ever meets
his employer, it must sort of show through and that his employer wouldn't find
that man very attractive. So this was his guiding theme.</p>

<p>The reason it appears that this country, the system in this country had to
go, had to be changed, was because of this supreme immoral way of managing
affairs here, the exploitation of man by man which occurs in this country.</p>

<p>We discussed about it occurring in the Soviet Union, the taxation of a man's
labor, it occurs there also, and it appeared that only, he seemed to agree or
sometimes I had to feed him, this conversation now is a later one, when we
were talking about the specifics of exploitation of man by man, he agreed
that the only difference was that in the Soviet Union it is a choice which is
impersonal.</p>

<p>The person who decides the man's wages and labor does not stand to gain
by it whereas in this country the man who decides stands to gain by it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The man who decides what, to employ the other man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; what wage to pay him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What wage to pay him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or what his return shall be. So that was the only&mdash;the most
important, by far economic and political almost, let's call it economic doctrine
he held.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he translate that economic doctrine to specific policies
that he thought should be adopted or specific changes that should be made in
the structure of this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had never, to my satisfaction, uncovered an area of progressive
change that he would advocate. I asked him how did he think this change was
going to come about, and he never answered that.</p>

<p>And it seemed to me he was critical of almost everything that occurs in
this country. So that he did not&mdash;I did not come to&mdash;did not know of anything
in which he could see a progressive evolutionary change or policies
that could be pushed in order to promote his ideals.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he react academically, intellectually, violently or in
what way did he express these views?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he was quite dogmatic. First he wanted to put me in a
category. In one of the later talks&mdash;when we first met he talked very freely
and then I think as we made, in later conversations, I had to do more and more
of it&mdash;make more and more effort to draw something out of him.</p>

<p>In his later conversations, Ruth found him so bothersome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was that word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Bothersome, that she couldn't join the conversations. He would
get too angry or <span class="locked">too&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He resented the probing or the questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not really resent the probing. For instance, take this
issue of the exploitation of man by man. When we had boiled it down to this
rather fine difference or technical difference that one was done by an impersonal
body and one was done personal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Soviet being the first and the American being the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. That being then the crux of the matter and the
reason this is the matter to be changed, if we were to follow the logic of the
discussion, many arguments seemed to approach at that kind of a point where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
is just logic or reason just didn't seem to work or hold water in this case, and
we were left then with the starkness of his statement that this was an unforgivable
moral sin, and he called it a moral sin or I questioned him to that effect,
and so he thought it was a moral sin and he thought he was moral by adhering
to that doctrine.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he appear to enjoy these give and takes between
you and himself or did he resent them as you proceeded in your discussions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think he resented them. I noticed at times he got quite
hot under the collar and I noticed that he was holding his, staying on a steady
keel even better than I was, as though he had had considerable practice in
sticking to, controlling himself, holding his position and not getting ruffled.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But in this process over a period of time during these
four discussions he never deviated from his basic thesis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Of course, as I said to the others, I don't believe whether you
were here, we only had about four talks altogether, and I later came to realize
that if he were to have abandoned any one of these or have abandoned that one
in particular, that would have undermined his whole philosophy, would humanly
itself quite unreasonable to expect a fundamental exchange within an evening,
just because of a logical compulsion or logical argument or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you get the impression that he felt both systems, the American
system and the Soviet system involved the exploitation of man by man
except it was a different exploiter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I gathered&mdash;I was irked because it seemed to me the difference
that he accepted as a sufficient difference, the one in the Soviet Union was impersonal,
that he was not, in other words&mdash;he admitted in the Soviet Union that
the tax rate which was a general term then for the amount of money or reward
that is not returned of what a man makes, was higher in the Soviet Union. He
agreed that that could be true, and didn't seem to be dismayed at that. So I did
not find criticism of the Soviet Union on that score.</p>

<p>And in fact he didn't&mdash;I didn't discover in what ways he would like to try to
change the Soviet Union except he didn't like the restrictions on his freedom
there. Neither did he see there was any connection between the restrictions on
freedom there and the freedom we have here without control of how the relationship
between men would be governed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he ever go into the question of the relative position of labor
in the United States from the point of view of its freedom of bargaining and
the control of labor in the Soviet Union? Did that ever come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I think, I can't remember whether it was a conversation I had
directly with him or immediately after, I was following this idea that here we
feel we have quite a different attitude about exploitation. Somebody&mdash;he felt
exploited and he thought all the working class was exploited, and he also thought
they were brainwashed, and he also thought that churches were all alike, all the
religious sects were the same and they were all apparatus of the power structure
to maintain itself in power.</p>

<p>When I pointed out that our church was financed by people like myself, when
I contribute so many dollars to the church, he just shrugged his shoulders. It
didn't&mdash;his views still stood and it also permitted him, I think, gave him the
moral ground to dismiss my arguments because I was here just a product of my
environment and I didn't know better and he had the word from the enlightenment,
that he knew the truth and therefore I was just spouting the line that was
fed to me by the power structure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think you mentioned before that he had wanted to put you in
a category, categorize you. Did he indicate to you during that first conversation
that he had concluded what category?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was over several conversations, I suppose it was the last
conversation we had, he couldn't put me in a category and he named about seven
or eight categories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wasn't a Bircher, I wasn't a liberal, a Communist, a Socialist,
probably something to do with religion, something like that, atheist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He didn't say whether you were a Republican or Democrat?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe he was concerned about that.</p>

<p>(Laughter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am sure he would see no distinction between the two
parties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So he concluded that he was unable to categorize you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And I also felt as soon as he had realized that that he
could then dismiss me as not something that functions in this world, not one
of the forces or the opposing camps he has to contend with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that your wife became bothered or Oswald
proved bothersome to your wife. Could you tell us in what way Oswald was
bothersome to Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think one of the most outstanding was in this discussion
of religions and I was trying to suggest that religions did embody many of
the values of many people and so the conversation was trying to talk about
those values quite apart from&mdash;I think the Russian, I think Marina's view of
religion is quite primitive&mdash;never mind Marina. Ruth was bothered by his
logic or argument being of no avail. She would be content, you know if he
had followed the laws of debate or something, you present evidence and he
presents opposite evidence and you try to answer, let one answer the other.
But when he couldn't answer he would just state his belief and there he followed
the Communist line.</p>

<p>He talked something about feudalism, or the church being more powerful
in feudalism than it was today and he tried to explain why that was.</p>

<p>I had then suggested that maybe science was instrumental as an alternative
explanation to his explanation but instead of supporting further his view, which
just didn't make sense to me, he just restated it. Well, this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Upset your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; you just couldn't enter the conversation deeper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any other conversation, you and Oswald
had during this first evening that you met?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. From the first day, are you going back to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think we probably spoke, I was trying still to find common
ground with him, and I think we probably spoke critically of the far right.
It even seems to me we may have mentioned Walker.</p>

<p>I had been bothered at the time that Walker had&mdash;I guess it doesn't do any
good to enter into the matter because I don't remember his response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you mention Walker's name during the first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My memory is very foggy. But I would take it as&mdash;this was an
impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Give us your best recollection, and I want to ask you again
this was in early April 1963, that you had this conversation, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was that first meeting when we had them over to dinner and
Ruth can give you the date of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For the benefit of the Commission the record indicates it was
about April 2, 1963, that that occurred. Tell us to the best of your recollection
what the conversation about General Walker was at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he had mentioned, a friend of ours had a German wife
and she just achieved her citizenship papers, and this had been done at the
ceremony and General Walker had been invited to lead the singing, conducted by
June Davis who is somewhat old and slipped into error of calling him Judge
Walker every once in a while, and it somewhat offended this friend of ours
who was aware of why she liked this country, freedoms, and liberties and values
that are expressed here. And she was rather sorry that Walker should take it
upon himself to define, to these stupid foreigners or these ignorant foreigners,
what this country stands for. So I think I mentioned this episode to him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Him being Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oswald, and I think he smiled and nodded his assent. I don't
think he said any&mdash;I don't think he made any important remarks about Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything that he said about Walker at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that is the only time, probably the only time we mentioned
Walker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. To refresh my recollection, there was about 2 days <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 8 days before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It was on the 10th.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he indicate in any way that he knew about General
Walker at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We seemed to agree at least superficially that in thinking the
far right was unfortunate in its thoughts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say anything or do anything that would lead you to
believe that he planned an attack on General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he indicate in any way that he knew about General
Walker's activities and beliefs and position on public affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I went to the ACLU meeting he then got up, stood up and
reported what had happened at the meeting of the far right which had occurred
at convention hall the day before, U.N. Day, they called it U.S. Day, and I think
Walker had spoken then.</p>

<p>From this I gathered that he was doing more or less the same thing&mdash;I thought
he was, I didn't inquire how he spent his free time but I supposed he was going
around to right wing groups being familiarizing himself for whatever his purposes
were as I was.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is that prior to the conversation you have talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; this is after this conversation.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is after this conversation and I only had this, this was the
only concrete evidence I had of how he spent, might have spent some of his
time. It happened in the ACLU meeting in late October. I suppose he was
familiar with the right-wing groups and activities, and movements. And certainly
familiar with Walker; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Confining the Senator's question to the meeting in April, he
didn't indicate in any way that he was familiar with Walker's attitude or
activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was familiar with Walker. He knew who Walker was, there
was no doubt about that. We were talking about Walker.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To find some common ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He didn't say he knew where Walker lived or anything of that
kind. That didn't come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate any understanding to you at that April meeting
of Walker's attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think he singled out Walker as&mdash;I had the impression that
he was quite familiar with Walker and probably familiar with the names of
various right-wing groups, shall we say, the Christian Science, not the Christian
Science, I have forgotten the names of various organizations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you relate to Oswald this story about Walker speaking at
the meeting or the ceremony at which the immigrants were given their citizenship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe I did; yes. I believe that is what I said about Walker
at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was his response to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I think he didn't say much. I think he smiled and nodded
his head and did that kind of thing. He may have said just a few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you take it that Oswald agreed with the views that you
expressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after this first <span class="locked">meeting&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I interrupt you again, I don't want to interrupt your
train too much but I think you had said that during this conversation that you
did have some discussion about right-wing groups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And their position and activities, and so forth. In that discussion
were individuals named or members assumed to be members of that
group?</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Ford left the hearing room.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is possible we would have mentioned Welch. I don't think I
would have mentioned Welch, I didn't know anything specifically about the
John Birch Society at the time.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was Walker, he was talking about Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was the only one whose name was mentioned.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Are you sure whether or not Oswald made any comment at
any time during this conversation about Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember, as I say, I remember it very vaguely but I
remember telling that instance of his conducting that ceremony. But&mdash;and
Walker was known, I knew that Walker was known to Lee. And at least it
achieved a certain feeling of similarity there, even though the similarity was
only superficial in our views and feelings about it. I don't think he went on
to describe any&mdash;it was mostly a ploy on my part to curry him or make him
feel more at ease.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was clear to you at that time that both you and Mr. Oswald
had an adverse view of General Walker and did not think favorably of him,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had you heard of Lee Oswald before you had occasion to go
and pick him up that time and bring him to your house for dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I heard about him as soon as Ruth had been invited to this
party back in February, whenever it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was the basis of your wife's interest in the Oswalds and
of your interest in the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Everett Glover invited us knowing that Ruth was studying Russian
and that&mdash;asked us if we would be interested in meeting this&mdash;they were presented
to us as an American who had defected to Russia and decided he didn't
like it and came back and brought a Russian wife with him. Would we like
to meet these people? Yes, that sounded interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this the Fort Worth group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; this is in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After this first meeting with Lee Oswald when was the next
time that you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That would be after he returned, when Marina was living with
us, when he returned, we thought he returned from looking for work from
Houston but apparently it had been his trip to Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us the circumstances of how you met him and what happened
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we have the date of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This would have been what, early October or late September
of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think Marina was there about a week, at least a week before he
came, if she came the 24th of September, which comes to my mind, it would be
in the early part of October. I would normally appear at the house on Fridays,
sometimes occasionally on Sundays, I would come on Friday evening, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were separated from your wife at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you had your own apartment at Arlington, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't particularly remember, the occasions don't stand out one
from another. The first two meetings, I think were before he found work, and
at first I talked a little bit about the problem of finding work with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These were the first two meetings after the preliminary meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. While Marina was staying with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go through your testimony, Mr. Paine and tell us as best you
can recall how many times you saw Oswald after his return from New Orleans,
up until the time of his assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I saw him every weekend on Friday; I think he was there
except for the weekend, before the assassination, exceptional.</p>

<p>I would arrive on Tuesday or Wednesdays and, of course, he was not there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
and there was Ruth and Marina. I would simply come in on Sunday when he
was generally there.</p>

<p>Also, I quite specifically remember on the long holiday he had some period
there, I don't remember, what celebration it is, when Bell did not have that
day off and he did, so he was there that morning, a Monday morning on that date
of that holiday, perhaps you can feed me the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would that be November 8th, 9th and 10th, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that the last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That would be correct; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, tell us the circumstances about how Oswald arrived in
Irving upon his return from New Orleans as best you can recall it, what happened,
what was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I must not have been there when the phone call arrived but I think
Ruth reported it to me so that Ruth said that Marina was very pleased, very
happy to receive this call, a surprise or something. I think I had at one or two
times seen her answer a call from him, and I observed she was glad to have this
call from him but I wasn't there when he first called, I don't believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was that the call from New Orleans to Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that is the call from somewhere in Dallas to Irving asking if
he could come out. I don't know of a call from New Orleans to Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he subsequently come out to the house in Irving that
weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then he came out that weekend. I suppose he came out on a Friday
and it was probably before I got over there, I arrived about six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember if he was there when you arrived home that
weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember that. I think he was there; yes. I think he was
there because otherwise I would have seen that meeting. I did not see them
first embrace each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say anything to you about where he had been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I thought I knew where he had been. Ruth had told me he was
looking for work in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Ruth had told you that before this date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was no conversation among any one at that time about
Oswald having been in Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was a complete surprise to Ruth and myself. When we saw
this letter where he mentioned having been to Mexico, Ruth took it as an example
of his colossal lying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about this letter, what were the circumstances surrounding
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He had written a letter using her typewriter and her desk to a
party I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is Ruth's typewriter and desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ruth's typewriter and he left the rough draft of the letter on her
desk, not folded, just out there on her desk, in English. Ruth had given me the
impression it was there for a couple of days. Actually it was there for a day
and a half or so. I think he wrote it on Saturday and we then moved the furniture
on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This would be Saturday, November what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This might be that holiday November. I don't remember for sure
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Paine, you and I discussed this question yesterday and I
asked you whether you recalled seeing Oswald again after you had discussed
this letter with your wife. What did you tell me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought probably not but we figured out the dates from my probable
reaction that I read that letter and then had I encountered him again I
would have had a different, I would have had questions or feelings or something
in response to this letter and since I didn't encounter him with those feelings I
must not have seen him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that would place the date of your seeing this letter as approximately
shortly after the weekend of November 8, 9, and 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit 103 and ask you if you ever saw
the original of this letter and if you did to tell us the circumstances surrounding
that event.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I saw this letter. I remembered most of the contents. I
apparently didn't remember that he didn't use his real name, I was reading something
else at the time and Ruth handed me this letter and it took a while&mdash;I didn't
read it as thoroughly as I could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you tell us just briefly the contents of this letter just for
the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, sir; apparently it is a draft of a letter that Oswald wrote
in his own hand. The Commission does have a copy of the actual letter, and it
was a letter to the Russian Embassy, I believe in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Russian Embassy in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, sir; in which he tells them about his trip to Mexico and
his political activity on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. I believe
it includes the words "notorious FBI," which is no longer interested in his
political activity in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this letter ever sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There was a letter sent like this? You said you had the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It is in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was sent, a letter like this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. A redraft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A redraft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Typewritten copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This letter refers to the fact that Oswald had been in Mexico,
does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it tells of his visit to the Cuban Consul and the Soviet
Embassy there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife call that to your attention when she showed you
this letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We took it, she took it, and I likewise took it as somewhat of a
fabricated story, I didn't suppose he had been down to Mexico. I read "Dear
Sirs" there, I read "Dear Lisa." I thought he was writing to a friend, and Ruth
pointed out to me after I had given the letter back to her, Ruth was somewhat
irked that I didn't take more interest in the thing. I think I might have&mdash;no, I
don't know as I might have since I might have dismissed it as a lie but anyway
Ruth was irked and didn't show it to me again and I asked her now what was in
that letter that I didn't see and she didn't tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was all prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ruth was quite bothered by that letter, and apparently had&mdash;apparently
I hadn't really taken it in. I said, "The heck with it. Yes; it is a
fantastic lie, isn't that amazing that he will fabricate such stories here."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she said&mdash;she approached me and said, "I never realized how
much he could lie" or that he was a liar or something like that, and "I want you
to read this letter." So I put aside the thing I was reading in which I was more
interested and read most of the letter, not the latter part about having used
another name.</p>

<p>And then I thought it was too personal, "Dear Lisa," so I thought he was
telling her, being rather braggadocio telling about his exploits which were rather
imaginary and I put it out of my mind. Then later Ruth asked me what did I
think about <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was before the assassination that she asked you this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it later the same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I think it probably was another day but I don't remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she was&mdash;I think I said, "Let me see that letter again," and
she said, "No; if you didn't absorb it, never mind." So, heck, if she felt that way,
I wasn't going to bother. My first impulse was to throw it aside and pay no
attention to it. If she felt that way I continued to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who brought the letter up the second time, did Ruth bring it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; Ruth brought it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether there was any event that caused her
to bring it up or did she bring it up out of the clear blue sky or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember having slept with her but I have the impression
she brought it up while I was in bed anyway. So it might have been, just be, I
was staying late that night also, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that Oswald had given Marina a charm made out
of a Mexican peso at the time that you read this letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn about that at any time prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you note the fact that Oswald had a record of Mexican
music in your home prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you subsequently learn that Oswald had given Marina this
charm made from a Mexican peso?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Under what circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The FBI came out and they were wondering whether Oswald had
used my shop to mount his sight so we went out to look at the shop and tools
and we looked at the threading tap and what not, the threading tap looked
as though it hadn't been used but the drill press seemed to have little chips
of metal on it and then Ruth remembered that he had gone in there and used
the drill press to have drilled out this coin which Marina put around her neck,
and I think she then mentioned it was a peso. But it hadn't sunk into Ruth
with significance of its being a peso, hadn't impressed itself upon her prior
to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that neither you nor your wife believed that Oswald had
been in Mexico prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You will have to ask Ruth about that. That was my impression
he hadn't been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your wife hadn't said anything to you that indicated that she
believed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you mentioned before the fact that you had gone with
Oswald to a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the day after Stevenson had been stoned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us the circumstances of that event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was a Friday I had intended to go, I had also invited
Frank Krystinik for his first visit, I had been telling him about the ACLU.
So I invited Lee to come thinking it might be part&mdash;I was not really talking
to him very much, but just being civil but I thought it might be helpful for him
to see something in which I was interested, that I might find some way that
he might find an interest, something constructive to do.</p>

<p>So, I took him in my car, he and I alone, and on the way, which takes about
35 minutes, described the ACLU to him, and he didn't know about it, and
described its purpose. Then we went to the meeting which was a meeting, first
we saw a movie called "Suspect," I think it was showing how a candidate lost,
who had won handily in a previous election, lost after a smear campaign in
Washington State, which it had been brought out that his wife had once been
a Communist Party member.</p>

<p>I didn't think the movie showed very much, but the meeting, the discussion
following the movie, there were two people who gave little talks about the
movie and the principles involved afterward, this&mdash;do you want to break?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who went with you in the car to the meeting, just you and
Mr. Oswald or was Mr. Krystinik with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; Krystinik came in his own car, so just Lee and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead with your story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought the meeting was conducted in a manner that illustrated
its own beliefs. One of the things said was that the Birchers must not be
considered anti-Semitic, anti-Semites because they are also Birchers.</p>

<p>Lee at this point got up, speaking loud and clear and coherently, saying that,
reporting that, he had been to this meeting of the right-wing group the night
before or two nights before and he refuted this statement, saying names and
saying how that people on the platform speaking for the Birch Society had said
anti-Semitic things and also anti-Catholic statements or spoke against the Pope
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't remember. He said something very similar to, "I disagree
with what had just been said," and I do remember that it contained
both some corroboration of his points of view. There had been some kind of
an anti-Semitic statement and criticism of the Pope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald seemed to make a convincing argument and seemed to
make sense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was good speaking. It was out of keeping with the mood
of the meeting and nobody followed it up in a similar manner but I think it
was accepted as&mdash;it made sense; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody else say anything in response to Oswald's remarks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened then later on in the meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Later on in the meeting, when the meeting broke up, people
clustered into discussion groups, and Frank, I told Frank, who was a colleague
at work, Frank Krystinik, about Lee and Marina, and so of course he immediately
came to defend free enterprise and what not in opposition to this fellow
I told him about, and I left the discussion at that point, thinking I knew the
kind of discussion it would be.</p>

<p>It was a discussion between three people, a more elderly man whom I probably
thought was a member of the ACLU, and Frank and Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear any part of the discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't hear any part of the discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you subsequently discuss it with either Oswald or
Krystinik?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And in the car going home, Lee asked me if I knew this man he
had been talking to, this older man he had been talking to, and I think he said
that the man seemed to be friendly to Cuba or rather he said, "Do you think
that man is a Communist?" And I said, "No." And then he said something,
"I think he is." Then I asked him why and I think he said something in regard
to Cuba or sympathy with Cuba, and then I thought to myself, well, that is
rather feeble evidence for proving a Communist.</p>

<p>But he seemed to have the attitude of, felt he wanted to meet that man again
and was pleased he had met him. I thought to myself if that is the way he
has to meet his Communists, he has not yet found the Communist group in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there a Communist group in Dallas, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever speak of a Communist group in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not. I had the impression, this I remember clearly
that he had not found the group with similar feelings to his. I then asked Frank
in regard to, I can't remember when I asked Frank but I asked Frank about
the same conversation and whether he thought that this third man was a Communist.
And he thought no, he thought the other man was a better&mdash;Frank
almost got into a fight with Lee, and the other man was more receptive or
didn't argue with him, or drew him out better, Frank used the word, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Drew Oswald out better?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Drew Oswald out better. But he didn't gather the impression
that he was favoring Castro or Cuba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What else did you and Oswald say on the way home after the
meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So I was describing to him the purpose of the ACLU, and he said
specifically, I can remember this, after I had described it and said that I was
a member, that he couldn't join an organization like that, it wasn't political
and he said something or responded in some manner, which indicated surprise
that I could be concerned about joining an organization simply to defend, whose
purpose it is, shall we say, to defend, free speech, free speech, per se, your freedom
as well as mine.</p>

<p>He was aware of enjoying his freedom to speak but he didn't seem to be aware
of the more general principle of freedom to speak for everyone which has value
in itself. And I think it took him by surprise that a person could be concerned
about a value like that rather than political objective of some sort, and this was,
struck me as a new idea and it struck me that he must never have met people
who paid more than lip service, he wasn't familiar with the ways of expressing
this value.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you say anything to him about the activities of the Civil
Liberties Union in connection with the defense of people accused of crimes
under certain conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I am sure I told him that it came to the defense of all people
who didn't seem to be receiving adequate help when it seemed to be an issue
involving the Bill of Rights. I was then&mdash;that was a pang of sorrow that occurred
after the assassination when I realized that he had then subsequently, a
fortnight later, joined the ACLU, and still didn't quite seem to perceive its
purpose, and then I realized&mdash;I had also perceived earlier that he was still a
young fellow and I had been expecting rather a lot of him, when I first approached
meeting him; this man had been to Russia and had been back and
I had been&mdash;met some others who had been around the world like that and they
are powerful people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald impress you that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And he did not impress me that way; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald respond to your, or did you request Oswald or did
you suggest to him that he join the ACLU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think I was eager to have him join until he knew
what was what about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time after the ACLU meeting did Oswald say
anything about his discussion with Mr. Krystinik?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you subsequently discuss that with Mr. Krystinik?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you say and what did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He told me how he had argued, that he had pointed out that he
had employed a few people himself, he works at Bell but on the side, at night
he had done a little extra business and had employed other people, and had to
receive from them more than he paid them, that he received from their labor,
for their product, more than he paid them but that he created work and jobs,
and he was fully&mdash;and he was ready to defend his way of that activity and was
presenting that against Lee's criticism and apparently encountered the same
kind of nonsequitur response or no response from him or Lee's response didn't&mdash;Lee
presented his opposing view against it without any issue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that Krystinik and Oswald had almost gotten
into a fight, did Krystinik tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was Frank who told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us more about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am sure Frank would not haul off and slug him, but just Frank
said he got pretty mad at this. I think Frank was using that expression to me
only, you know, saying how irked he was at Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't indicate that Oswald had threatened any physical
violence toward him in connection with the argument, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no; I think Lee knows how to keep his temper, knows how to
control himself.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Might I ask a question at this time?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
Earlier you talked about your, I think your, first meeting with Oswald and
your conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said, you talked about, the fact that subsequently your
wife was bothered by his attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was bothered <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I am not going into that.</p>

<p>Now, you have talked about this conversation with Mr. Krystinik?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Krystinik.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. In which they reached some point in which further discussion
was not, if not impossible, was at least difficult between them?</p>

<p>From these experiences you had was there a situation, that after some
arguments or discussion of economic or political issues, he would reach a point
in which he relied upon certain fixed positions that he held about which he
would not admit of any further discussion or argument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. He would just present his dogmatic view and
then one was at loss to find any way to get off that impasse.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When he was questioned about that view or when an
attempt was made to argue that view with him, would he then become angry
or disturbed in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The time that I reported I was angry and I noticed he was
holding his temper pretty well and I wasn't going to let him hold his temper
better than mine.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see <span class="locked">indication&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw he was angry, his hands trembled a little bit.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But he was dogged, I think he was practiced or skilled or took
pride in this was a kind of struggle or fight that he would do this, and he
would do it for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Clench his fists and put them together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was expressing this as a mood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He would hold himself back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He would oppose himself to you steadily, and it seemed to me he
liked to put himself in a position of belligerence or opposition, and he would
just hold his ground or something, was accustomed to doing that and expected
to stick it out. It reminded me a little bit of Lawrence of Arabia when Lawrence
held the match that burned down to his finger and the fellows asked him
what is the trick? He said no trick you just learn how to stand the pain.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I have to go and I would like to ask a few questions.</p>

<p>I ask these questions to get a certain background of his views which you
have said he finally came to some fixed position which he would hold and
would not move and there was no brooking of real argument on that position.</p>

<p>You said earlier in response to a question by counsel that he did not believe
there was any possibility of any evolutionary progress in this country, at least
upon this issue of economic change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This he never said that specifically. But I would ask him what
policy should we take or I was trying to find if he didn't have some avenue of
following a policy in this country.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you direct questions to him which showed some evolution
in our own economic ideas and theories which he either refused to <span class="locked">accept&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did. I mean I tried to show him how labor and management,
first labor had a right, I was criticizing labor for the rigid position it is
getting us into <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He would not accept that idea of evolution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he did not accept it; yes.</p>

<p>He didn't have patience with it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is that also a tenet of the Communist dogma, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe, I don't know whether you can say there is a
single Communist dogma of that sort. I suppose there are some groups that feel
that way and others don't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he indicate any other way in which he thought that
economic change might come about in the United States?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not indicate or reveal to me how he thought it would
come about and I on several occasions felt by his, perceived from his attitude
or felt impelled by his attitude to say that the values that I held dear were
diminished in a situation of violence, to which he remained silent and I took
it as disagreement. But I don't remember if he had said that.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He remained silent when you spoke about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I said I was opposed to violence or said, why, when I said
that he remained silent and I took <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You took it that he disagreed in any way by your statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, just by the way he would sort of withdraw.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He did not agree with your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not agree; no.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That violence was unacceptable as a means of change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right, and I don't think he perceived also, was a war
of the kind of values that I am&mdash;tolerance, for instance seems to me disappears
when strained <span class="locked">situations&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you discuss at least the kind of economic changes that
had occurred in Russia by means of violence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I was trying to find out whether he thought it was going to
come by revolution or not and he never did say, I never got an answer as to
how he thought this change was going to come. He did not reveal constructive,
or from my point of view, constructive effort to make.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever discuss the revolution in Russia where by
means of violence the change had come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not. That would have been the kind of argument I would
have accepted, a normal kind that you would have accepted it as evidence
here is the normal way to produce it, but he never said that.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever say any way in which he was expecting Russia
or any other country to indicate that he felt the use of violence had produced
good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. As I say he did not&mdash;I would have accepted that argument
as a debating argument but he didn't bring it up.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he say or did you get the impression that he felt that
violence was the only way to improve things, let's say, in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt he was so disgusted with the whole system that he didn't
see a way that was worthwhile fussing around trying to modify the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Other than violence or he didn't go that far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He didn't mention advocating violence or didn't say anything in
regard to violence but he did seem to me he didn't see dismissed as trivial, no
difference between the parties so why join one party or another. They were
all the same.</p>

<p>Churches&mdash;there is no avenue out that way. Education&mdash;there is nothing
there. So that he never revealed to me any constructive way that wasn't
violent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he think that communism was different from capitalism in
this respect?</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right, gentlemen, the Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What I was getting at with my question was as to whether he
thought that probably violence was necessary with respect to both systems to
achieve the millennium that he sought or did he think it was just necessary
with regard to the American system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He didn't reveal to me to my satisfaction what criticism he found
of the Soviet Union. He had indicated he didn't like it. But I wasn't aware
that he was proposing to change that system also in some way. Neither did
he ever speak, he never spoke to me, in a way that I could see a paradise, see
his paradise. He spoke only, he was opposed to exploitation of man by man.
That was his motivating power.</p>

<p>(At this point Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald indicate to you in any way that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
present at the right-wing rally that was held in Dallas the night before
Stevenson appeared in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He indicated that at the ACLU meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say he had met anybody there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that I recall, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he mention speaking to anyone at that meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you whether or not he was at the Stevenson meeting
itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess I didn't ask him that. I remember asking myself subsequently
what was the answer to that question and I couldn't answer it then
and I can't answer it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no recollection of his mentioning it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't remember what&mdash;I think I assumed that he had
<span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You assumed that he had been at the Stevenson affair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I assumed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any basis for that assumption?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There had been some discussion in the ACLU, some other people
had gotten up and had spoken of that awful last night, I guess, this was the
previous night, that awful time and I think he seemed to nod his assent. That
was <span class="locked">my&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You inferred from that that he had possibly been present at
the Stevenson meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was no other basis for your assumption in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the weekend of November 8, 9, and 10, do you recall when
you came to your house in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I would come out regularly on Friday after cashing my
check at the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember coming on Friday evening on the 8th of
November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember any break in that habit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall whether or not Oswald was present at your
home on the Friday evening November 8, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't specifically remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember one way or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you at the house on Saturday? November 9th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was at the house probably on Saturday and certainly on Sunday.
I think that weekend I remember stepping over him as he sat in front
of the TV, stepping past, one of these things laying on the floor and thinking
to myself for a person who has a business to do he certainly can waste the time.
By business I mean some kind of activity and keeping track of right-wing
causes and left-wing causes or something. I supposed that he spent his time
as I would be inclined to spend more of my time if I had it, trying to sense the
pulse of various groups in the Dallas area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know what Oswald did on Saturday morning, November
9, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that he was taken by your wife to apply for
a driver's license and take a driver's license test on that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She told me sometime subsequently that she had taken him for&mdash;wait.
I remember the incident that he had arrived on a Saturday morning
at the drivers' license bureau, stood in line for a long time but they cut off
the line at 12 o'clock and he did not stay there long enough for him to get
his driver's license student permit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this at this time or would that have been another time.
Let me help you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it help to refresh your recollection if I suggested that
November 9th was a local election day in Dallas, I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that is an election that I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no knowledge of Oswald's activities on that day, no
direct personal knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It doesn't, it didn't cue me in, so I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Oswald drive a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with him driving an automobile or obtaining
a driver's license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I probably said it would be well to get a driver's license. It
would be well&mdash;I probably said, "You probably need a car to get around here."
In other words, effectively; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate to you that he planned to purchase an
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I bought this second-hand car for $200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of a car is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a 1956 Oldsmobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you buy it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I bought it while they were there, while Marina was staying
with us, which was sometime in November. Either October or November, probably
the early part of November. They went out to admire the car. $200, I
suppose, didn't seem out of their reach then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you that he was <span class="locked">thinking&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Therefore, I think Ruth, they went out to admire the car and,
of course, I was thinking that it, this might make it appear to them that the
car was within reach, and driving was something to be sought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In addition to the Oldsmobile that you mentioned, you personally
own a Citroen automobile and your wife owns a station wagon, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never saw Oswald drive any of those cars at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. I had keys to both of my cars so he could not
have driven them <span class="locked">without&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Without your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or else somehow getting another. He would have to&mdash;you can,
I have driven my car when I have broken the key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you never saw him drive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw him drive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife ever tell you that she had seen Oswald driving
a car or she was trying to teach him how to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she indicate what proficiency he had at operating an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She thought he was, she observed how much one has to learn in
order to drive a car. He had a difficulty in some manner, perhaps it was in
judging when to turn the wheel when parking. And I think she said he over
controlled it, turned too far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Looking back now on all your conversations with Oswald, after
his return from New Orleans, did you have any discussions with him other
than the ones you have already mentioned in your previous testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question before you answer this question. About
the car, did you get any idea as to why he didn't want to drive a car or to
have a car, did he think this would make him a capitalist or anything of that
kind? Did anything come up in the conversations with regard to his not
having a car or not driving a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I gathered that was slightly embarrassing not to be able
to drive a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you recall any conversations that you had with Oswald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
that you think would be helpful for us to know other than the ones you have
already mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall one now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate to you any specific hostility toward President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think at this ACLU meeting he mentioned this specifically that
he thought Kennedy had done a good job in civil rights. That was it&mdash;generally
my impression was that he liked&mdash;he didn't like anybody, but he disliked
Kennedy least as you might go right from Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your recollection, was that the only time he
mentioned President Kennedy specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate any hostility toward the United States
other than the hostility that you have previously testified to after his return
from the Soviet Union and his general dislikes of the American system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Just his general dislike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate to you a desire to return to the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I think when I learned, I don't know when it was that he
had planned to go back there that it was a surprise to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you learn that he planned to go back there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was probably subsequent; yes, that was certainly subsequent
to November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or to go to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or to go to Cuba, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When that was <span class="locked">spoken&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember now, first it was mentioned could he be connected
with a Communist plot and there I thought of Russian Communists and that
didn't seem to ring a bell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was that mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was after the assassination, a day or two later. Then when
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee was mentioned, that was the first I had
heard of it except for his mentioning Cuba to this man at the ACLU meeting
referring to it in the car to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never told you that he had been active in the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct, that was the only recollection I could remember
his ever having mentioned Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now yesterday, we asked you about an incident or spoke to
you about an incident that happened in September of 1963 when you went into
your garage to use some tools, your garage in Irving, Tex. Would you tell us
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember whether the date was September. I remember
that was the date they came back from New Orleans and I do remember that
my wife asked me to unpack some of their heavy things from their car. I only
recall unpacking duffelbags but any other package, that was the heaviest thing
there and they were easy also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You must have moved the duffelbags from the station wagon into
the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. I unpacked whatever was remaining in the station
wagon to the garage.</p>

<p>So sometime later, I do remember moving about this package which, let's say,
was a rifle, anyway it was a package wrapped in a blanket. The garage was
kind of crowded and I did have my tools in there and I had to move this package
several times in order to make space to work, and the final time I put it on the
floor underneath the saw where the handsaw would be casting dust on it and
I was a little embarrassed to be putting his goods on the floor, but I didn't suppose,
the first time I picked it up I thought it was camping equipment. I said
to myself they don't make camping equipment of iron pipes any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why did you say that to yourself when you picked up the
package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had, my experience had been, my earliest camping equipment
had been a tent of iron pipes. This somehow reminded me of that. I felt a
pipe with my right hand and it was iron, that is to say it was not aluminum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you make that distinction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. By the weight of it, and by the, I suppose the moment of inertia,
you could have an aluminum tube with a total weight massed in the center
somehow but that would not have had the inertia this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were just feeling this through the blanket though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was also aware as I was moving his goods around, of his rights
to privacy. So I did not feel&mdash;I had to move this object, I wasn't thinking very
much about it but it happens that I did think a little bit about it or before I get
on to the working with my tools I thought, an image came to mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think there was more than one tent pole in the package
or just one tent pole?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As I say, I moved it several times, and I think I thought progressively
each time. I moved it twice. It had three occasions. And the first
one was an iron, thought of an iron pipe and then I have drawn, I drew yesterday,
a picture of the thing I had in mind. Then in order to fill out the package
I had to add another object to it and there I added again I was thinking of
camping equipment, and I added a folding shovel such as I had seen in the
Army, a little spade where the blade folds back over the handle. This has the
trouble that this blade was too symmetrical I disposed to the handle and to fit
the package the blade had to be off center, eccentric to the handle. Also, I had
my vision of the pipe. It had an iron pipe about 30 inches long with a short
section of pipe going off 45 degrees. No words here, it just happened that I
did have this image in my mind of trying to fill up that package in the back
burner of my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The witness yesterday did draw a picture of what he visualized
as being in the blanket, and I will offer it in evidence later on in the hearing.</p>

<p>How long was this package in your estimation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, yesterday we measured the distance that I indicated with
my hand, I think it came to 37 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately how thick would you say it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I picked it up each time and I put it in a position and then I
would recover it from that position, so each time I moved it with the same
position with my hands in the same position. My right hand, the thumb and
forefinger could go around the pipe, and my left hand grabbed something which
was an inch and a half inside the blanket or something thick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it occur to you at that time that there was a rifle in the
package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That did not occur to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never at any time looked inside the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. I could easily have felt the package but I was
aware that of respecting his privacy of his possessions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you subsequently advised of the probability or the possibility
that there had been a rifle wrapped in that package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I arrived on Friday afternoon we went into the garage,
I think Ruth, Marina and the policeman, and I am not sure it was the first
time, but there we saw this blanket was on the floor below the <span class="locked">bandsaw&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(At this point Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And a rifle was mentioned and then it rang a bell, the rifle answered,
fitted the package that I had been trying to fit these unsuccessfully.
It had never resolved itself, this shovel and pipe didn't fit in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it seemed to you likely that there had in fact been a rifle
in the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That answered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us when the last time was that you saw that package
in the garage prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am afraid I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do we have the date of the first time in the record?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I think the witness testified it was either late September
or early October of 1963.</p>

<p>I show you a blanket which has been marked as Commission Exhibit 140
and ask you if that is the blanket you saw in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This looks a little cleaner, of course. I was there in the night,
and I also put the thing on the floor thinking it was rustic equipment and that
sawdust wouldn't hurt it.</p>

<p>I also was concerned with moisture. This is very close to what I remember.
Yesterday in my testimony I had a desire to add blue to the colors of brown
and green. Last night I remembered that Thanksgiving weekend I had bought
another rustic blanket of a similar nature which had blue in it, which is why I
tried to get blue into the blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you able to say at this time positively that this was the
blanket that you saw in your garage and that you moved on various occasions
in October and possibly November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't notice the particular design so I can't&mdash;it is a very good
representative of what I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the texture of the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The texture. I felt it, of course, these several times and the texture
is the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was the package wrapped securely when it was in your
garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had the impression&mdash;yes, it was. The whole package was stiff.
There was no shaking of the parts, and I had the impression it was wrapped
with about two strings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I now show you Commission Exhibit 139, which is a rifle
that was found in the Texas School Book Depository Building, and ask you if
you at any time ever saw this rifle prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you seen it since that time and prior to yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw a rifle being shown to Marina in an adjoining cubicle
with a glass wall between us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the night of the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever seen this leather strap that is attached to the
rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have not seen that strap.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever seen a strap like this strap?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or anything like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you any idea where this strap could have come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask in that connection, was this just loosely wound up
in that blanket or was there some string around it <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had the impression there were about two strings on the thing.
It wouldn't&mdash;also, I didn't think you could look into the package readily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You would have to take something off, some string or something
in order to get into the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I now show you Commission Exhibit 364 which is a replica
of a sack which was prepared by authorities in Dallas, and I also show you
another sack which is Commission Exhibit 142, and ask you if you have ever
seen in or around your garage in Irving, Tex., any sacks similar to those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you seen any paper in your garage in Irving prior to
November 22, 1963, or at any other place, at your home in Irving, Tex., that is
similar to the paper of which those sacks are made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I haven't; we have some rugs, most of them are wrapped in
polyethylene. I couldn't be sure that one of the smaller ones wasn't wrapped
in paper. To my knowledge, we had no free kraft paper of that size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you examine the tape on the sacks and tell me whether
you have any tape similar to that or whether you have seen any tape similar to
that in your garage before November 22, 1963?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We have some tape in a drawer of my desk at the house, my
recollection is that the tape is a 2-inch tape, gum tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the tape on the sack appears to be three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is 3-inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever observe in your garage any scraps of paper or
scraps of tape similar to the materials used to construct those sacks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Either before November 22, 1963, or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you moved the sacks, the blanket, the package that was
wrapped in the blanket in your garage, were you able to determine whether
or not the object inside the sack was also wrapped in paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would have said that it was not. When we practiced wrapping
that rifle yesterday I would have guessed that any paper around the barrel
in there, which I could feel with some clarity, would have crinkled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And to your recollection there was no crinkling in the package
wrapped with the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It was a very quiet package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yesterday we did try to and did wrap the rifle previously
referred to in our testimony in the blanket which you have just examined.
Would you tell the Commission about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I tried wrapping it to the shape and size and bulk that I remembered
the package. I had a little difficulty, it got quite close to the right shape
by wrapping it at an angle. The rifle was laid in the blanket somewhat on a
bias to the rectangle blanket form. Then there was a small end of the barrel,
I didn't discover how you could fold that over to tie it with string without
making it bulkier than I remember. But the package came quite close to what I
remembered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now on the basis of wrapping that rifle in the blanket, would
you say that it was probable, that the package that was in your garage was in
fact that rifle wrapped in that blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I think it was or a rifle of that size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said just a moment ago that you saw the rifle we have had
here this morning or a similar rifle shown to Marina Oswald sometime shortly
after the assassination. Would you tell us the circumstances surrounding that
event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We went to the police station that evening, and probably about
9 o'clock, I saw the rifle being shown to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was at the Dallas police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Dallas police station. Ruth was present, and Mamantov was
present.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who was the last one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ilya Mamantov, I think Ilya is the first name, but Mr. Mamantov.
He teaches parttime, parttime teaching in Russian, was familiar to Ruth as the
son-in-law of her tutor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear any of the conversation that was going on in the
room in which Marina was being shown this rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether or not your wife heard them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My wife, of course, was right there. And heard the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she subsequently tell you what occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She told me that Marina wasn't able to identify that rifle as the
one that Lee had. She knew that Lee had a rifle, and I think she knew it was
wrapped in a package like this. I think Ruth reported that she had, Marina
had, opened up a corner of the blanket and looked in and seen part of the butt,
and hadn't liked the idea of rifles, the rifles made her a little uncomfortable and
hadn't looked at it further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was at the time the rifle was presumably wrapped in the
blanket in your garage, correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I assumed that. I didn't ask that question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife tell you anything more about what happened at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You will have to jog my memory if you have any specific questions.
I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is the best of your recollection now that you have given
us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much would you say that the package that you saw in
your garage weighed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I reported earlier to the FBI 7 or 8 pounds. I never at the time
thought of the weight of it as I was moving it around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In your previous discussions or conversations with the FBI
did you ever tell them in word or substance that if there had been a rifle in
the package that was located in your garage that you did not think it could have
a telescopic sight mounted on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall having said that. I don't believe I would have
known that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall any discussions of that sort with the FBI at
all. Did they ask you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I think they asked me coming out to find out when and
where and how the sight may have been put on but I never felt the package
in the center. I always grabbed it at these two ends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your recollection you never told the FBI that
you didn't think the package contained a rifle with a telescopic sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever observe or hear prior to the assassination that
Lee Oswald had been practicing with a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I didn't know prior to the assassination, we didn't know he
had a rifle. I had supposed from my conversation with him back on Neely
Street that he would like to have a rifle but I didn't gather that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Aside from whether or not you knew that he had a rifle, did
you ever hear or observe him practicing with a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you familiar with the Sport's Drome Rifle Range in Grand
Prairie, Tex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I know about where it is. No, I don't even know where
it is. I know the race track is there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that Oswald received mail at your house from
Irving, Tex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know what kind of mail he received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose he used it as the mailing address for most of his mail
until he would receive, get a permanent address, so he received the Daily
Worker there, or The Worker, and also, I didn't see it come, I don't generally
see the mail that arrives there. Most of my mail would arrive at that address
even though I was living somewhere else because I also didn't feel permanent
in my other addresses, so Ruth would collect the mail and separated mine into a
separate pile. I didn't see the Militant arrive. I did see various Russian
magazines, Agitateur, maybe a very large one. A very large one and the Daily
Worker, The Worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss these publications with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, we talked with regard to the Daily Worker. He said that,
he told me, that you could tell what they wanted you to do, they, a word I
dislike, what they wanted you to do by reading between the lines, reading the
thing and doing a little reading between the lines. He then gave me an issue
to look and see. I wanted to see if I could read between the lines and see what
they wanted you to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you read the particular issue that he referred to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I tried to. I don't think I had very much patience to go through
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what particular issue it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I didn't notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you set the date of this discussion that you had with
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was fairly soon after his coming back. So let's say the
middle of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he discuss with you, your ability or inability to determine
what they wanted you to do by reading between the lines after you had read
the publication?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I just handed it back to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anything else said between you at that time on that
subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He asked me how did I like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I tried to be polite. I said it was awful extreme, I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he respond to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that was the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do I understand that this was, this Daily Worker was,
<span class="locked">mailed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To 515.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. To your address in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Or Ruth's address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It wasn't readdressed but it was directly sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He gave your address for The Worker to come to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What prompted him to hand you The Worker? Was
there any preface to the actual handing of it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I think I was asking him, I would like to, I wanted to
see some literature or what he liked to read or something like that. I think
it was as a response to some question or inquiry of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know whether this was addressed to him in care of
you or Ruth Paine or was it just sent at the Paine address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember for certain. I would think it would have
just been Oswald at that address but I don't remember. It may have been.
There were enough of those packages but I just don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you draw any inference at the time as a result of this
conversation with Oswald about his statement that you could tell what they
wanted you to do by reading between the lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it made me realize that he would like to be active in some
kind of&mdash;activist. It made me also feel that he wasn't very well connected
with a group or he wouldn't have such a tenuous way of communication, and
I thought it was rather childish to someone like Dick Tracy, attract a child to
Dick Tracy, to think that that was his bona fide way of being communicated
or being a member of this Communist cause or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any other discussions with him about literature
that he received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't know. Other literature, I was somewhat interested in
what the Russian publications were saying but I didn't take it up with him.
I wanted Ruth to translate those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever observe any Cuban literature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever know that he ever received any such literature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I never, until after the assassination, I had never thought
of Cuba either in connection with Oswald or in connection with the Communists
or the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit 128 which is ENCO Map of
the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and ask you if you recognize that map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is the kind of map that I always used, stopping in stations
when I am out of one so I always have one in my car, and when the FBI
showed me this particular map, which I trust is the same one I looked at before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
I found on the back side a mark where it shows the whole map of the whole
area, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, a little mark where our house is, that is the
kind of mark that I would make when I was trying to buy some land earlier
and had in mind for a long time and I wanted to find the location that was
accessible to the places I would then want to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell <span class="locked">us&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This mark is still here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is the mark or can you identify that mark that
you placed on this map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I think I see a mark here of the sort which looks reasonable
to me. I think it is the only mark on this side of the map.</p>

<p>Generally, I didn't make marks on the other side of the map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In your statement referring to one side of the map you were
referring to the side that shows a map of the entire Fort Worth-Dallas area,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you say as best you can see there is only one mark on
this side of the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the only one that is here, that I remember having found.
I don't remember finding another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember putting that mark on the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember putting&mdash;I think I put this kind of mark on more
than one map. That is our house. It then helps locate it with regard to all
the arteries and what not that lead to various places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You do think then it is probable that you did place the mark
on the map that indicates the location of your house in Irving, Tex.; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I think that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether or not Oswald ever came into possession
of this map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And Ruth gave Oswald a map to&mdash;she told me she gave him a map,
and this is the kind we have around the house, the best one she could get in the
service station, to help him find a job, or help him when he was searching for
a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any other conversations with your wife
about the map before the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't believe she told me she had given him the map. I
don't believe we discussed it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you open the map to the portion that shows the area of
Dallas. I call your attention to a mark at the intersection of Boll Street and
San Jacinto, and ask you if you have any recollection of placing that mark on
the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't have any recollection of placing that mark on the map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any circumstances that might make it likely
that you placed that mark on the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I could have placed that mark on the map when I was looking for
properties. I went down to the courthouse to get plats of the areas that I was
thinking of buying, and they had a copy of the plat, and so they sent it out late
on Saturday, short of 12 o'clock, and just short of closing, and it was a reproduction
company at that address or near that address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the L.&nbsp;L. Ridgway Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. That is the company that I am referring to. I don't know
exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it is near the intersection we have just referred to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will take your word for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know that it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't know. I think the FBI man said it was. I hadn't looked
into it and didn't check it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You haven't any knowledge at this point whether the Ridgway
company is in this intersection or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember it is right beside the expressway and in about that
area. I don't remember the names of the roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think it is probable or improbable that you placed the
mark on the map, the one we have just been talking about, at Boll and San
Jacinto Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember in asking the clerk where it was, and I had a map of
this sort, that was also in August when I was looking for places. I would have
guessed I would not. I would have been able to see where it was and know
in my mind where I wanted to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is that the same kind of a mark or a different kind of mark
that is on the other side of the map to which we have just referred, the area
map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a different mark. That mark that is on the other side of
the map to which we have just referred, the area map, was our house. So I
made a little square that I can see and indicate a house rather than&mdash;generally
I don't make marks on maps. I look up where I want to go and I go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife tell you when she had given this map to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose she gave it very soon after he came back and started
looking for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you said it was August of 1963 when you were looking
to find this reproduction place; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I call your attention to a mark on Hillcrest and Asbury, and
I ask you if you put that mark on the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall making that mark. I think it is different from the
other mark, and it is&mdash;if I were to make a mark that is more the way I would
make a mark. It also happens to be the cafeteria where I like to eat, where
you can get all you want for a dollar there, and it is a very good meal. So I
would be interested in that, in locating it. Here is one of the places where I
was thinking of buying property.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is there a mark there at that place where you were interested
in buying property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think there is. I almost guessed that I didn't have that
map at that time. Also I was not living&mdash;I would guess for a further reason
that I would not have this map on the time of that August date was because I
hadn't been living&mdash;I had been living in this apartment, and I had a map over
there, and I probably didn't have the same map that Ruth had around her house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you think it is probably likely you didn't place any marks
on that map other than the one indicating your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. In other words, I think that mark was placed
there quite a long time back, because I have been interested in this locating of
property for several years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is the mark at the Hillcrest Avenue spot, a mark of the type
that you usually make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And, as I say, I don't usually make a mark, but I think I might
more likely have made that kind of mark, more than some of the others&mdash;somebody
else has put marks here with a ball-point pen which are not the
kind I would make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In reviewing this map with the FBI, were there any other
marks on the map that it was developed that you possibly put on the map
other than the ones we have discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't now remember any others. This one of the cafeteria
there is not exactly at the right spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The mark at Hillcrest Avenue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you look at the map now do you see any other marks which
you think you might have put on the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. We went over it at mealtime in considerable detail, he
having located most of the marks he could find on the map&mdash;no, I guess it was
still marked up like this. We didn't find anything that I can remember there
that I might have put on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, on the basis of your knowledge of Oswald and your meeting
with him, and your familiarity with him prior to the time of the assassination,
did you form an opinion about him as to whether or not he would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
likely to commit an act such as this, or whether he would be likely to take the
life of any human being?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a question we had to consider when we considered having
Marina at our house. So Ruth and I discussed that, whether he was a dangerous
person, and he didn't seem to be dangerous. Of course, I also felt that I
wasn't a particular opponent or foe of his. Helping his family we were quite
free and would let him, roughly, think of our arguments. I talked about getting
angry, but, for the most part, it was a cordial relationship, so I didn't sense&mdash;he
didn't display hostility to me or to Ruth, and he was nice with the children,
and while they were living with us, he was nice to Marina also. He was during
this time when he returned from Mexico, he was quite a reasonable person. He
was only unreasonable the first time I had met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you have this discussion with your wife concerning
whether or not you should let Marina live with you? Was that before they
came back from New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you concluded at that time there was no reason why
Marina should not come there; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Of course, Ruth went in and sounded them out
rather cautiously and reported to me also his facial expressions and what-not
when she was suggesting this, and he seemed to be glad of that rather than
worried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after Marina came and lived at your house, Oswald was
there during parts of the months October and November. Did you change your
opinion in this respect or was it reinforced, on the basis of his activities and
your observation of him during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was reinforced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not think him to be a violent person or one who would
be likely to commit an act such as assassinating the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't&mdash;I saw he was a bitter person, he was bitter and quite a
lot of very negative views of people in the world around him, very little charity
in his view toward anybody, but I thought he was harmless.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this a different reaction from the one you had
had at your first meeting or your first acquaintance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When we first became acquainted I was somewhat shocked,
especially that he would speak so harshly to his wife in front of a complete
stranger, and it was at that point, or at that time, that I was persuaded I
would like to free Marina from her bondage and servitude to this man. He
seemed to me he was keeping her, not helping her to learn the language, keeping
her vassal to him, and this offended me, so at that point I became interested in
helping her escape from him. Of course, I was not going to try to force that.
I didn't want to be separating a family that could get along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This bitterness that you detected following his return from
Mexico, was that a new reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. That bitterness had existed all along. He also had been
disagreeable to his wife, cruel to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not allowing her any personality, a mind of her own, and making
sharp jibes at her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And that continued awhile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That only existed that first night in March or April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It did not continue when Marina was at your house in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When Marina came to our house she gained in health and weight.
She started to look better and it looked to me as if the strain was off the family
relationship. They were not quarreling. They billed and cooed. She sat on
his lap and he said sweet nothings in her ear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you get any information from any source with regard to
the situation while they were living in New Orleans that she wanted to get away
from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; well, Ruth had told me when she came back from delivering
Marina to New Orleans, she had gone down there expecting to spend
a week, seeing New Orleans, and it was a pretty long trip, and found the household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
she reported to me, so uncomfortable living there. They were fighting,
I mean, so difficult. She wanted to leave right away, and she left in a few days,
left a lot sooner than she had expected to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Then your wife took her back, as you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then, my wife came home, and then she went back to Naushon,
Mass., for a couple of months in the summer, and on her way back to Texas
stopped in New Orleans, found him out of work, and invited Marina to come
back with her right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did she learn at that time about Oswald? What did she
learn about Lee Oswald's treatment of Marina, anything new or different at the
time she stopped by New Orleans, and then went back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She, perhaps, saw he loved her because she said that the parting,
he genuinely seemed so happy to have Ruth take her back. In other words, he
seemed to be exhibiting some concern for Marina, who was with child, and the
child would be adequately taken care of, and sorry&mdash;it was a cheerful parting
or something. She saw human qualities in him at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she say after Marina returned to your home in Irving, and
after Oswald came back to Dallas that their relationship improved even more,
and Oswald seemed to be under less strain than he had been prior to that time;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I don't&mdash;I only know two times, at the time in April when
they came to dinner with us, and he was rough, crude, uncivil to her, and Ruth's
report of how they were while she was trying to live in this house in New
Orleans, when she just moved in.</p>

<p>She also reported to me, and she will tell you this though that apparently
Lee had wanted to make her happy in this house, had liked the house, said it
was in the old famous quarter of New Orleans, and Ruth could see that Marina
was unhappy. She thought it was uncomfortable in this darkness, and Ruth
thought it was a tragedy. Both points of view were valid depending on which
way you looked at it, so she saw that Lee apparently had wanted to make her
happy, wanted her to like the house when she arrived in New Orleans, and
had called her out there. She had also been eager to go out.</p>

<p>Apparently Ruth reported to me when he called from New Orleans, saying
he had a job and "come live with me, come back with me," Marina had been
very happy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you specifically consider the question before you let Marina
move into your home as to whether Oswald was a violent person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, specifically. I talked it over with Frank. Frank raised the
question also. So I talked it over with Ruth several times, and Frank brought
up the question, and I thought of it myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you concluded on the basis of these discussions and your
knowledge of Oswald, your collective knowledge of Oswald, at that time that he
was not a violent person; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he wasn't going to stab Ruth or Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That he wasn't going to exhibit any violence to any of you
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. He wouldn't be a danger to Ruth. That was partly
based, first, on the fact that we were not&mdash;we were careful to avoid putting him
in a position that he felt offended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't consider at the time that you were considering
Oswald's possible violence toward you and your group whether he might exhibit
violence to some other person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You formed no judgment about that one way or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. We assumed or felt that&mdash;if we handled him
with a gentle or considerate manner that he wouldn't be a danger to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In the light of subsequent information and developments, and
the information which is publicly available, have you reached any other conclusions
as to or any conclusions as to whether or not Lee Oswald was the
assassin of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When the police first asked me did I think he had done it, my
dubiousness in my mind arose from not seeing how this could fit, how this could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
help his cause, and I didn't think he was irrational. It did not seem to me that
he could shoot a man as he would shoot a tin can. Difficulty of a person
shooting another person was not the reason for my doubting, and the circumstantial
evidence seemed quite powerful to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Seemed quite powerful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But then I realized with subsequent people calling from
all over the country, somebody had said it is only a single-shot rifle, and I recognize
one little fact like that could alter my thinking entirely. Somebody else
said there was a shot through the windshield of the car. We went down to the
place and looked around, and he thought that&mdash;he had a theory that the man
had been shot from a manhole in the street, so I recognized that my views
could change with evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have a view on Oswald's guilt at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Most of these other things have proved to be false. It seems to
be a clip-fed rifle. The man who thought it was shot from the place, I went
down and saw the diagram drawn by Life seemed to be quite accurate so far
as I could reconstruct the thing, and there was confusion about the number
of bullets. I never did discover&mdash;it didn't quite make sense, but for the most
part, I accept it, the common view that he did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you on the morning of November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was having, at the time of the assassination I was at work, of
course, but at the time of the assassination I was in the cafeteria associated
with the bowling alley having lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A student, a co-op student called Dave Noel happened to be with
me. We happened to be talking about the character of assassins at that lunchtime,
of all things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Prior to the time you heard of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. When we first sat down at the meal we were
discussing it, beside the point, except unless you believe in extrasensory perception,
but we happened to just&mdash;we didn't have enough historical knowledge to
explore it, but I just raised the question and tried to pursue it, and then dropped
it, and then a waitress came and said the President had been shot, and I
thought she was cracking a nasty joke, and went over to a cluster of people
listening around a transistor set, and heard there was some commotion of this
sort from the tone of the voice of the transistor set, and we went back to the
lab where there is a good radio, and followed the news from there.</p>

<p>When it was mentioned, the Texas School Book Depository Building was
mentioned, then I told Frank Krystinik that that was where Lee Oswald worked,
and then in a few minutes he came back and said, he asked me, didn't I think
I had better call the FBI and tell them.</p>

<p>So over a period of about 20 minutes, I trying to carry on work in a foolish
way, or talking or discussing other things or something, we were discussing
this problem, and I thought, I said to myself, or said to him, that the FBI
already knew he worked there. Everybody would know he was a black sheep,
and I didn't want to&mdash;a friend or one of the few friends in position of friendship
to him, I didn't want to&mdash;join the mob barking at his heels or join in his
harassment, so I declined. I didn't tell Frank that he couldn't call the FBI,
but I said I wasn't going to do it, so I didn't.</p>

<p>I called Ruth immediately after getting back just to see that she would turn
on the radio and be clued in with the news, but this was before the Texas
School Book Depository Building was mentioned, to my knowledge, and she was
already watching the news. So we communicated nothing at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know whether your luncheon companion did or did not
telephone the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is not the luncheon companion. This is Dave Noel. Frank
Krystinik brings his lunch, and he eats his lunch at the lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At the lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Paine, would you give us the nature of the conversation
you were having concerning assassination prior to the assassination. First let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
me ask you was anybody else present beside you and your companion at the
time of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, just he and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us the general essence of the conversation as best you can
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There had been talk, of course, people, I don't get a newspaper,
but I do listen to the radio. I know what my news source is, it is mostly magazines.
So there was some anxiety about the President coming to Dallas-Fort
Worth, and it appeared that this thought was in the minds of several others,
I was not singular in this way. It had been expected, of course, that trouble
would come from the right-wing, and I was wondering whether there was any
danger, I suppose, that is somebody who could be drummed up by local feeling.
The number of anti-Kennedy jokes cracked was quite large in Texas, and so I was
wondering, you know, what kind of a person would kill a President, and I don't
think Dave Noel knew anything about it, so it was just musing or conjecturing
on my part. I certainly didn't think of Lee Oswald. I didn't expect it from
that cause, from that end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you first think of Lee Oswald in connection with
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As soon as I heard the Texas School Book Depository Building
mentioned. Now, I did not know that&mdash;it never occurred to me, I didn't realize,
there was a building there on his route. I had seen this warehouse building
from the expressway, you can see the name written in large letters, but that is
the way from any main thoroughfare. So I had supposed, I never put&mdash;except
when it was mentioned that that was the building he shot from or was the
building that the shot was fired from, then I realized I did know where he
worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You had not been at Irving that previous night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You knew Oswald worked at the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As soon as you heard that that building was involved in the
assassination, you thought of Oswald, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Wondering whether Oswald would do it. And the argument
against it, the only argument against it, was just I didn't think he was irrational,
or it seemed to me to be irrational.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you asked yourself the question of whether or not Oswald
would do it solely on the basis of your knowledge that he worked in that building,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Well, I didn't realize he worked in that building, but then
I realized I didn't know&mdash;I knew he worked at that organization. I didn't realize
there was a building on Elm Street there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to your wife after you heard that the Texas School
Book Depository Building was involved in the shooting, and before you subsequently
heard that Oswald had been arrested in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so. I think I called her only once to see that she was
listening to the news, and then I assumed she would know all that I knew, and
as soon as she heard that I supposed she would be wondering the same thing.
It wasn't many minutes later though, it seemed to me, that the name Lee Oswald
was mentioned&mdash;in the theater. The newsmen didn't connect it up at all, but
that is all I needed to send me home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So then you left for your home in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You left for home before there had been any public connection
made between Oswald and the assassination, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, of course, the police were reporting they had suspects here
and suspects there, were chasing suspects over here, and here was a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
had shot Officer Tippit. They didn't even mention him as a suspect, but there
was another murder coincident in time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So the news broadcast connected Oswald with Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you then consider again whether or not Oswald had been
involved in the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that was too much to have his name mentioned away from his
place of work as having killed somebody; the stew was too thick to stay at work,
and I was shaken too much, anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So your testimony is that you first thought of Oswald after you
heard of the Texas School Book Depository Building being involved in the
assassination, but you concluded at that time that Oswald was probably not
involved in the assassination; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there any other reason other than the fact Oswald was at that
building that made you think of him when you heard that building mentioned
in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, yes; Oswald, of course, stands&mdash;he is a black sheep in society;
I mean he is, if you were to pick out the singular person among the employees
there, he is the one, or he is probably the one. I don't happen to know the people
who worked there. I gather from him there were about 30 people working there
in a fairly large building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was your state of mind when you heard that the Texas
School Book Depository Building was involved in the shooting, did you deeply
suspect Oswald had been involved, or was it just a passing thought? Tell us
some more about that if you can, recreate your state of mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I was nervous. I know I was trying to assemble a vibration
meter and could not put in the screws or I kept making mistakes. I was
preoccupied. Of course, the darn fools, we should have all stopped to mourn
the President, but it is kind of a habit, I wasn't accustomed, habit drove us on,
very unhappy or unresolved emotional time. I thought, firstly, Frank was quite
insistent, he didn't just ask me once, but several times, whether I didn't think I
should call the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you why he thought you should call the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he would have, but he is of that nature. At one time he had
seen someone taking pictures of Hensley Field, which has signs on the outside
"No Photographs Allowed," and I said I believe more in freedom. It seems to
me if the field doesn't want the pictures taken, they had better put up a big
fence. But he had gone ahead and called up the base commander, and the base
commander knew the man. That was his normal mode of behavior, whereas my
normal defense is of the individual, and I didn't think&mdash;I would not like to,
if Lee is falsely accused, I wouldn't want to be jumping on him with the mob.
If he is properly, if he is guilty, he will be found. They know he works there, he
is connected to us. I couldn't contribute to his capture, so that my withholding
information wouldn't harm the search for the right man, and having jumped
on him unfairly I might be ashamed of that later on. So that was my feeling
in regard to whether I should call the FBI. I think I just kind of felt cold
sweats or something like that in regard to the question could he have done that
thing. I don't think I went much beyond that, could he, could he.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Krystinik indicate to you any reason for his desire to call
the FBI? Did he suspect Oswald had done this on the basis of his knowledge of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me very reasonable that he should think so. Of
course, I don't think the others were so sharply aware, the others in the lab
were so sharply aware that we were wrestling with this problem.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. He didn't say anything to you, he didn't tell you any other
reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, he didn't; but his reaction seemed perfectly reasonable to me.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt the same one&mdash;if you were to pick out somebody in that
building, it was a rather singular coincidence we knew this man who was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
negative to our society and not an ingratiating person, not a person with compassion
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What time did you arrive at your home in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would guess about 3 or 3:30, somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was there when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The police, the Dallas police mostly were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your wife was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My wife and Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what you said when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know. No, I don't remember what I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you say in words or substance, "I came right home as soon
as I heard the shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository Building?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I came right home as soon as I heard Lee Oswald mentioned.
I did not come home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember saying that you came right home as soon as
you heard that Oswald was involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I think I said something like that. Ruth asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you mentioned before that after you arrived home you
went into the garage when the police officers went into your garage. Was there
any indication to you at that time that the garage had been previously searched
by the police or anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This I don't remember very well. But, as I remember, this was
not the first time we had gone in there. I think, perhaps, they went into&mdash;I
don't remember, but I don't think it was the first time they had gone in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said when you did go into the garage, however, the blanket
was there in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was. It was still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was said in
respect of the blanket and search of the garage, as you say. Before you answer
that question, let me ask you, did your wife go with you into the garage with
the police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think they were further in in the garage. I think I stayed&mdash;the
band saw is fairly close to&mdash;there is an overhead door to the garage, and close
to the under edge of that when it is pulled up. In other words, it is fairly close
to the outside in the garage, and I think I stayed somewhat near the door entering
the garage, which is the inside end of the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your wife was with the police officers further in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I think she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Marina Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Failure of recollection, I would say, yes. But it is a very fuzzy
recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us where the blanket was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It doesn't really make sense as to why they would still leave the
blanket there, and these things would have been discussed at that time, but I
kind of remember a kind of silhouette situation, a police officer either lifted
up or kicked this blanket, which was in exactly the same location that the rifle,
the package had been, underneath the saw and somewhat in the sawdust. And
I think he put it back there. He may have asked me at that time, "Did you
know what was in this?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And that is why I think they asked me, it may have been as
early as that, whether it was a rifle, "Do you think it could have been a rifle?"
I don't remember how it was posed, but I probably answered when it was suggested,
it was a rifle, and there they suggested it was a rifle, because they had
already learned from Marina that he had had a rifle, and it had been, perhaps,
had learned it had been in that blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know they had previously asked Marina about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; but I think&mdash;I'm just telling you my impressions here, very
fuzzy impressions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My impression was that they asked me if I knew what was in
this blanket, or he asked me, and then he asked me if it could be a rifle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
I probably responded, yes. It didn't take long once the rifle was suggested as
the object to fit this puzzle together, this puzzle of the pieces that I had been
trying to assemble in the package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What else happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We went out of the garage, I don't think he took the blanket
then even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is the Dallas police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, plainclothesman, wearing black hats; one of them had one
of those Texas hats. He collected all the useless stuff in our house, he went
around and collected all the files of Ruth, and a drawer of cameras, mostly
belonging to me. I tried to tell him one of the files contained our music or
something like that, and the more I suggested it, that he not bother taking
those, the more insistent he was in taking those objects.</p>

<p>So with the various boxes and piles of stuff, mostly of our stuff, we got in
the car and went off, and he was quite irked that we had wasted quite enough
time around there, he said, and Ruth was irked, and everybody was irked by
it. He wouldn't let us be helpful, and thought we were&mdash;he became angry
when we tried to be helpful or something that we would suggest that he should
do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you how they happened to come to your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I don't remember. I think I may have asked it, "You found
us pretty quickly," or somebody said this, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any other conversations about this blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anyone notice any scraps of paper or tape similar to the
ones of which these sacks were constructed that we previously identified, particularly
Commission 142?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there anything else that happened during this period prior
to the time the police left that you think would be significant or that we ought
to know about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; very little happened. We just bundled up and went. Marina
was&mdash;whimpered a little bit, but mostly it was dry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You went with the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We went with the police in several cars and didn't come back
until quite a lot later that night, didn't go into the garage again; didn't want
the Life reporters to take photographs, so I don't think they went in the garage
to take photographs. Several&mdash;their possessions were searched by various waves
of succeeding policemen, Dallas, and Irving and FBI, and what not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, there has been a report that on November 23, 1963, there
was a telephone call between a man and a woman, between the numbers of
your residence and the number of your office, in which the man was reported
to have said in words or substance, "We both know who is responsible for the
assassination." Have you been asked about this before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had heard that&mdash;I didn't know it was associated with our
numbers. I had heard a report that some telephone operator had listened in
on a conversation somewhere, I don't know where it was. I thought it was
some other part of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to your wife on the telephone at any time during
Saturday, November 23, on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was in the police station again, and I think I called her from
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you make any remark to the effect that you knew who was
responsible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I don't know who the assassin is or was; no, so I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are positive in your recollection that you made no such
remark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us your impression and your opinion of the
relationship that had developed between Marina Oswald and your wife during
the period that they knew each other up to the time of the assassination and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
subsequent to the assassination when, as we discussed briefly yesterday, there
came to be a cooling off between them or a disenchantment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ruth was mostly learning the language, so she was limited in her
vocabulary and couldn't talk about&mdash;she explained to me she couldn't talk
about&mdash;political or economic subjects. It was a topic on which her vocabulary
didn't serve her, but it did appear she had spoken of quite a number of things.
Marina had told her about movies she had seen in the Soviet Union, but I thought
that the knowledge, Ruth's knowledge, I suppose Ruth's knowledge of Marina
was fairly shallow. And Marina was quite reserved. Now, it may have been
more so when I was in the house that she was not as much at ease as she was,
perhaps, with Ruth herself.</p>

<p>Of course, Marina was in a position where she always had to be polite.
Ruth is easy to get along with, however, so I didn't expect Marina to have
difficulty. But I didn't think Ruth and Marina were bosom friends or buddies,
but neither, of course, I didn't mean to suggest the opposite.</p>

<p>Ruth was enjoying Marina's company and I was glad to have Marina staying
with Ruth. It actually reduced the cost. Ruth saved money. The bills were
less while Marina was there, and Ruth, in general, was happier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you <span class="locked">learn&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't think Ruth knew Marina very well, but I don't know
how well she knew her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn subsequently or are you aware that subsequent to
the assassination there has been a disenchantment or some strain between
Marina and Ruth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Several things happened. Ruth was put out when she learned
Marina knew afterward that Oswald had taken a shot at Walker, if that were
true. She thought that was quite morally remiss on Marina's part, and so
we talked about that thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When did she learn that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was in the newspaper report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She only learned it through the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. So we discussed the mitigating circumstances of
Marina not knowing the language and not knowing who she could go to if she
wanted to stay in this country and, perhaps&mdash;we believe there were extenuating
circumstances which would, perhaps, excuse Marina. Ruth was troubled about
that, and so she wrote a series of quite a number of letters, each one referring to
previous letters, trying to discover whether they were being withheld, thinking
Marina was a responsible person or normally civil person, she would normally
respond to or at least acknowledge receipt of them.</p>

<p>So Ruth didn't know whether she was receiving them or not, and had another&mdash;some
encounters with Martin and Thorne which didn't put her at ease. She
still didn't know whether Marina was receiving them. She saw only some of
the checks had been signed by Thorne rather than Marina. Thorne had said
that Marina didn't say he had power of attorney, and Marina was trying to do
everything that she could which, at least, she could sign her checks, checks or
gifts.</p>

<p>So there were these indications. Ruth was very much in the dark, not knowing
why she had received no communication from Marina, and having conflicting
reports from Martin. Martin said she had a phone right beside her
if she wanted to call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did she receive these checks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess Ruth&mdash;some of the checks came to Ruth as gifts to her,
and Ruth would write her own check so she got her own stub back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Therefore, Ruth had this question of whether she had offended
Marina or whether Marina had done something that offended Ruth or whether
Marina didn't like Ruth and had never let on. This would be a great blow to
her ego. It had Ruth in great periods of depression and anxiety.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did either you or your wife, to your knowledge, know Robert
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We only met him for the first time on the night of the assassination.
We both liked him at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Paine, is there any other subject that we haven't covered
in the testimony that you think the Commission ought to know about in connection
with this assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe there is anything else that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no more questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you have any questions, Mr. Dulles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The only question I have in mind is as to what took place as
far as Mr. Paine is concerned on the night of the assassination. Were you in
the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We went down to the police and stayed there until about 8 or 9
o'clock. Then Marguerite came home with us and spent the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't see Lee Harvey at that time, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They asked me and I declined to see him at that time. I changed
my mind. When they immediately asked me, I declined. I did not know what
he would ask me, so I did not see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You did not see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did your wife see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think no one saw him. Marina went in the next morning hoping
to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There were no conversations that took place that evening that
are pertinent to our investigation so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Quite soon I called the ACLU. There were reports, yes, I think at
that time, that Friday night, Marguerite was saying he wasn't receiving counsel,
and so I called the ACLU to see if there was anybody there checking to see
if this was true, and apparently a delegation, this was Saturday morning, and
apparently a delegation had been sent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But to your knowledge neither you nor your wife had any conversations
with Marina or Robert that would throw any light on this apparent
coolness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ruth apparently saw Marina this last weekend. We have some
indications that people had gone between, chiefly Levine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You think money considerations had anything to do with this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think quite a lot&mdash;it will be borne out, between Ruth and
Marina subsequently, I think they will find the difficulties. I think <span class="locked">Thorne&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What I have in mind is as to whether some of these other people
thought that you and Ruth might intervene in as business manager or something
of that kind between them, and the monetary considerations that were coming
in to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We didn't know why. We have the feeling that Thorne was
advising her not to speak to Ruth. Ruth is not interested in the money, but
is interested in protecting her from the wolves, and so she thought, we both
thought, there were some false stories being told to Marina in regard to Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will examine Mrs. Paine this afternoon at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 1:05 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="rhp"><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:20 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Before I ask you to be sworn, Mrs. Paine. I will give you a little
general indication of what our testimony is apt to cover.</p>

<p>We have heard that you and your husband made the acquaintance of the
Oswalds somewhere during 1963, and that Mrs. Marina Oswald lived in your
home from late September 1963, I believe, to the time of the assassination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
Since we are inquiring under our mandate into the background and the possible
motives of the assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin,
we will question you regarding your association with Mr. Oswald and try to
glean from you any other facts that may bear upon the assassination or its motivation.</p>

<p>I believe you have been furnished with a copy of the executive order under
which we are operating as well as the Congressional resolution?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Now if you will please stand, I will swear you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would like to affirm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give in this
investigation will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Will you state your full name for the record and your
address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am Ruth Hyde Paine. I live at 2515 West Fifth Street, in
Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mr. Jenner is going to conduct the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your maiden name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is Hyde.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ruth Avery Hyde.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are wife of Michael Ralph Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were born September 3, 1932?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are almost 34 years old.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Almost 32. I will be 32 in September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Pretty bad arithmetic. Just a little bit of your background, Mrs.
Paine, very little. Your mother and father are living?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your mother is an Unitarian Minister ordained in the
Unitarian Church at the moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And received her degree in theology last summer I believe, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, she has completed her work for a Bachelor of Divinity Degree
from Oberlin College and she will receive it in the spring. They don't give
them in mid-year. She completed just the first of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You yourself are a college graduate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Antioch College?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yellow Springs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yellow Springs, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a brother and sister.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your mother, your father, yourself, your brother, and your
sister are your entire family.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My immediate family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother is a graduate of Antioch also, he and your sister.
Are they older than you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which is the elder of the two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My brother is the oldest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your brother is a professional man, is he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He is a doctor, general practitioner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A general physician, and he practices in Yellow Springs, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us where Yellow Springs is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is about 60 miles south and west from Columbus, Ohio, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
capital, which is more or less in the middle of the State, and just a little bit east
of Dayton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your brother married.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does he have a family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He has four children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is your sister married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does she have a family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She has four children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And each of your brothers and your sister, it is their first
marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you were married to Mr. Paine December 28, 1957, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were married where, in Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was suburban Philadelphia. Friends meeting in Media, Pa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us what the Friends meeting is which you have
mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am a member of the Society of Friends often known as
Quakers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a Quaker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you embrace that faith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I joined in early 1951, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has any other member of your family embraced the Quaker
faith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; my brother is also a Quaker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did he embrace that faith.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Similar in time, a year or two one way or the other. I don't
recall exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am afraid I might have been inattentive. When did you say
that occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Similar in time. I don't remember just when exactly he joined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was thinking more as to when you said you did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In early '51, I think; I am quite certain it was winter of '51.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then in college?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the year out. I went to Antioch one year and then
I took a year out and I joined my home meeting in Columbus which I had
already attended perhaps 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And from the time you joined the Quaker church you have been
a member of that church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or that faith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or church; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ever since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you and Mr. Paine, did you take up a residence in Philadelphia
as soon as you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had been living in Philadelphia working there, and then when
we married I moved to suburban Philadelphia where Michael was living,
Paoli, Pa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His folks live in Paoli, also, do they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His mother and stepfather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you remained in Paoli until when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it was summer of '59 we were in the process of moving,
didn't complete it until fall of '59.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. You moved to where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To Irving, where we are now, to the present address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To your present home? And that was in the summer of 1959?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At some later stage we will go into what occurred. In the
meantime we have you now in Irving, Tex. Is that a suburb of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and your husband purchased the home you have there before
you went down.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no; we stayed at a small apartment for several weeks looking
around and then rented for a year, and then we purchased the house we have
been renting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you purchased that and moved in in 1960, is that about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We first moved into it in the fall of '59.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You rented it and then purchased it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The same house; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, thank you. You have two children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A boy and a girl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A girl and a boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you name the oldest of the two.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Sylvia Lynn and the boy&mdash;she is now 4. The boy is Christopher
and he is 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The point I was getting at, your daughter, Sylvia, was born after
you reached Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was her birth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was born on November 17, '59.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1959. Now you are acquainted, became acquainted with Marina
Oswald, did you not, in due course in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I first met her and her husband at a gathering of people
in Dallas at the home of Everett Glover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Okay. I had not met her before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this time you and your husband were living in your present
home in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In '59.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the time that you met Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. Michael moved to an apartment in September of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There had been some strained relations or difficulties between
yourself and your husband Michael. When we shake our heads we don't get it
on the record.</p>

<p>The answer to that is "Yes"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is "No." I had not met her when there had been some strained
relations between me and my husband. It is just we are having difficulties with
words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I was getting at&mdash;there had been some strained relations,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mr. Paine had moved to separate quarters. This was in
September of 1962, correct.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You met Marina for the first time when.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I judge it was the last of February, towards the end of February
of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then living with your children in your home at 2515.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. West Fifth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. West Fifth Street in Irving, Tex. Now would you please relate
the circumstances under which the meeting between yourself and Marina
Oswald first occurred in February of 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was invited to come to the home of Everett Glover to meet a few
friends of his, and I judge that was on the 22d of February looking back at my
calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please tell us who Mr. Everett Glover was and how
you became acquainted with him.</p>

<p>What was the milieu?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met Mr. Glover at a group gathered to sing madrigals together.
These are old English songs where each part has a melody and it was for the
enjoyment of reading the music and in harmony, and we often had coffee afterward
and would talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This included your husband, however, did it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had a common interest in this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Madrigal singing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Madrigal singing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And went together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then Everett knew that I was interested in learning Russian
well enough to teach it, and since this gathering was to include some people
who spoke Russian, he invited me and he invited Michael also to attend.
Michael caught a bad cold and wasn't able to go.</p>

<p>I went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, could I interrupt you a moment here. Though your
husband was living in his own quarters, the relations between you, however,
were not so disruptive but what you were friendly, and you were attending these
singing groups?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. I saw him perhaps once or twice a week for dinner
at my house, and we went out to rather more movies than some of my married
friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was reasonable cordiality?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. I don't wish to pry into your private life.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If it is pertinent, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, there is some necessity. We might touch a little on
your private life if you will forgive me for doing it. Mr. Glover, is he a single
person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was at the time of the party. He has been divorced from his
wife. He is now remarried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now I interrupted you at the point at which you were relating that
Mr. Glover had raised with you, I assume this was a telephone call, that he was
going to have some guests. He knew of your interest in the study and the learning
of the Russian language and its use?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do I correctly summarize it up to the moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have an entry in your calendar as I recall on this subject.
There is a question mark.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall it says "Everett?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I hand the witness the document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This will be Commission Exhibit No. 401. Gentlemen for the
purpose of identification of the exhibit, it is Mrs. Paine's calendar which she
used in part as a diary and part to record prospective appointments and she
surrendered it to the FBI. This is not merely a photostat, it is a picture taken
with a camera of that calendar.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 401 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I ask you a question or two about it Mrs. Paine. Did you
not go through each of the pages of that calendar with me this morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I asked you, did I not, whether it was all in your
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Except for the identification on the front, the officer who
received it from you&mdash;he made a notation of the date of receipt&mdash;it is all in
your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is in the same condition now, isn't it, as it was when you
surrendered it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn to the diary page to which I have reference in
connection with the first meeting with Marina Oswald, and that is what month
and what page and what date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is on the page for February, and the only thing I <span class="locked">can&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. February what year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. February 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the day please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is a notation on the 22d of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, there is a square with the figure 22 in it indicating
February 22, 1963. Do you have something written in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is written in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It says "Everett's?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that all there is in that square?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you explain that and how it related to what you are now telling us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe it refers to the invitation to come to his home. As I
recall, he telephoned me twice, first to say that they might get together a group
of people, hence the question mark. Then he called again to say they were
going to have a party, and to make the invitation definite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you used the expression "I believe." Is that your best
recollection at the moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I went over this with you this morning and you gave me the
same explanation, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now did that event take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what is your best recollection as to the day of the month
it took place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no other way of guessing when it was except to assume
that this notation means it was on the 22d of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that does represent your present best recollection refreshed
to the extent it is refreshed by the memorandum before you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right, and of course this <span class="locked">first&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What day of the week was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was a Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Friday night. You attended the party did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I believe you used the word Friday. I don't believe she did,
Friday night. You said Friday night.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was Friday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Friday evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The 22d was Friday. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You used the word "evening"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was an evening party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was held in Mr. Glover's home was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is his home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At that time he was living in the Highland Park section of
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How far from your home is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Half hour drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By what means did you get to Mr. Glover's home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I drove.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You owned or then had, or maybe you still have a station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it the same car still?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is the same car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you arrived, were either of the Oswalds present?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not sure I recall accurately. I think they came a little
after I arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give us your best recollection of all the people, couples
if you can remember them that way, and then single persons or persons there
without their wives or husbands, as the case may be, that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I will try. The Oswalds, two were there, Marina and
Lee, Everett Glover, the host, Mr. and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt who were the
friendship link between the Oswalds and Glover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could I interrupt you there? Had you known the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had never met them. I have not met them since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the only occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you ever saw either Mr. or Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had no conversations, no letters, no contact whatsoever with
them either before or after this party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct, no contact whatsoever before or after. There was
a roommate of Everett's. Dirk, I think, I forget the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you attempting to recall his first name or his last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His first name. I may be wrong. It was a young German fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Schmidt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do you know the first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, I don't recall the first name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And he had two roommates, so that is two other single men,
and I don't recall their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was each of them there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were both there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were two roommates.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two roommates and they were both present at the party. I should
remember their names but I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And there was a couple who lived in Irving; again I don't recall
the name. I don't believe I have seen any of these people since with the
exception of one of the roommates once, and again I don't recall the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see the roommate the <span class="locked">second&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I may have seen him since. All these people were new to me
when I came to the party with the exception of Everett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see the roommate the second time before or after
November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, it was before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it is a fact that none of these people who were at the party
other than Mr. Glover had you seen or heard of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to the time that the party was held.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you exhausted your present recollection as to the people
who were present on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't get a name. The couple were living in Irving, I recall
that, but I don't&mdash;I have forgotten their name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now the Oswalds arrived shortly after the party began or at
least after you arrived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe they came with the De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were introduced, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I was introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. It was a very informal gathering. Marina was
wearing slacks and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt also was. I doubt pains were taken
with the introductions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I doubt any pains were taken with the introductions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did the party proceed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It must have started something after 8 o'clock and went until
towards midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have an interest in square dancing and that sort of thing
also. Did you do any of that then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. We talked and ate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do any madrigal singing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No singing that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now before I get to any specificity with respect to Marina and
Lee Oswald, was Russian spoken that night by anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who else at the party had some facility with Russian in addition
to Lee Oswald and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just the De Mohrenschildts, both of them, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And yourself. Did you mention that Mr. Glover had some interest
in the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't believe he does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not, all right. Were the Oswalds really the center of
attention that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so, yes, although you can't say that there was a single
center for the entire evening. It wasn't like being invited to hear what he had
to say. It was much more informal than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you speak with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you converse with her during the course of the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very briefly. She spent the first part of the evening trying to
get June to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. June is her daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The little girl with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She brought her daughter with her did she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, and then we talked some in the kitchen with Mrs. De Mohrenschildt,
Marina and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what subject did you ladies pursue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I really can't remember. The actual conversation with Marina
didn't cover much time at all. I saw very little of her that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you remember any subject you talked to her about in the
kitchen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What subjects were discussed, I assume in the living room or&mdash;where
everybody was gathered? Do you recall what was being pursued there in
the way of conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Part of the time Lee talked with people who were asking him
about his trip to Russia. I believe Everett had told me that he had been, so I
knew that when I arrived. And the fact that he had gone intending to become
a citizen in the Soviet Union. He talked freely and with considerable interest
in his subject to the three or four people around him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you gathered in that group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Part of the time at least I was listening to that. He spoke of
the things about the Soviet Union that had displeased him, as for instance the
censorship. He knew that it had been going on regarding his letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, when you talk in terms of conclusion, we have a
little trouble testifying. If you will give us examples such as you just gave us
about censorship, could we go back a moment to the conversation about his
going to Russia. During the course of that subject, in questions put to him,
was anything he listed as to why he went to Russia? May I have a yes or no
first?</p>

<p>Do you recall anything like that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't be certain that this is when I first got an idea about
why he wanted to go or whether I learned this later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your memory serve you enough so that there is a fair possibility
that&mdash;it is important to us&mdash;was the subject discussed at that gathering?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now would you give us your best recollection of what he said
or what Marina said, but primarily what Mr. Oswald said on that subject.
Why did he go to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I carry the impression, and I think it is recalled from this
<span class="locked">evening&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. When you say you carry the impression you are
saying "It is my present recollection."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. That he spoke of himself as a Marxist that evening,
that he had read certain Marxist books and thought that the Soviet economic
system was superior to ours, and wanted to go to the Soviet Union and live there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What response was elicited from others at the meeting, agreement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I would not say there was any agreement. People were
interested. This is an unusual thing to do. And they were interested in hearing
how he found Soviet life, what he thought of it, whether he was pleased or
disappointed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough to tell the members of the Commission
what Mr. Oswald said in those respects, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He mentioned that he was displeased with the censorship, or at
least he commented on it in a way that I took as unfavorable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, Ma'am.</p>

<p>Did he say he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What had happened, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What censorship is he talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He referred to a letter that had been sent to him by Robert Oswald
that he later learned, after he had come back to the United States, had been
sent. He had not received it. He judged that they had simply stopped it, and he
commented that they are more apt to just take a letter than take out a piece of it
and then send it on, and that censorship is more obvious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go on.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wondered, listening to him, whether he really <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, please. Before we get to what you wondered about,
exhaust your recollection as to what he said, what others might have said on
the subjects in his presence about which he talked.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned, also, Mrs. Paine, that there was discussed that
evening the subject of his return to America.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Obviously, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why he returned, was that subject discussed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not very much, no. I can't recall any specifics relating to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All you can recall, I take it, at the moment, is that there was an
allusion to the subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he was clearly here, yes. He had come back, and&mdash;well, I
have to put it in terms of what I guess or what I feel was his reaction. I can't
give you a specific recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have no objection to your doing that. We would like to have
you first state all you can recall as to what specifically happened in this instance.
How did Mr. Oswald treat or regard&mdash;what relationship did you gather existed
between Marina and her husband, a cordial one as of that occasion, separating
from what you learned afterward, but just this initial instance. What impression
did you have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Almost none. There was very little contact between them during
the evening. He spoke English to those that were asking them questions. She
was either in the bedroom by herself trying to get the little baby to go to sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
or in the kitchen speaking Russian to the De Mohrenschildts. I listened more
than I spoke in that situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When Mr. Oswald was in the living room with you ladies and
gentlemen, the conversation was in English, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, that when Marina returned to the room Russian
was spoken, at least by those who had command of the Russian language.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When she was in the same room, there was more than one conversation
going on, and in two languages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When anybody spoke to <span class="locked">Marina&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was in Russian. When people spoke with each other other
than with Marina, it was in English, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in very short compass what was your impression of Mr.
Oswald at that initial party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought he was pleased to be interesting to this group of people
and glad to tell them about his experience, to answer their questions. He seemed
open and forthright. I did wonder as he was talking about it whether he had
come to the conclusion after being in the Soviet Union that their system was
inferior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Inferior to ours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To ours, or whether he still thought that the Soviet system was a
better one. His discussion of the censorship made me feel that he wanted his
listeners to know that he was not blind to the defects of the Soviet system,
but it did not convince me that he was in favor of the American system. I was
left wondering which country he thought conducted itself better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have an interest in the Oswalds at this moment wholly
apart from your interest in the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you intellectually curious about them is all I meant.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes. Well, it is most unusual to take such a step as he took.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had some notice in advance of this meeting, Mrs. Paine,
of the fact that Mr. Oswald was at least&mdash;there had been publications of his
having been a defector?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I wasn't aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first learn of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, a name is always given to someone who goes to the Soviet
Union and wants to have citizenship there, isn't it, so I could well have assumed
that there had been such, but I really didn't learn about it until after the
assassination, I guess. No; I take it back.</p>

<p>There was a reference now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Specific recall. It is coming. The content of Robert's letter to
him, as I recall, included a clipping from the Fort Worth newspapers relative
to his defection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine, you are talking about a letter of Robert
Oswald's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A letter from Robert to Lee which Lee never got but heard about
when he came back to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was the subject of discussion that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That came up, so, therefore, I did know that he had been called
a defector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Robert refer to this letter or did someone in the meeting
refer to the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lee referred to the letter in discussion of censorship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But up until that moment, you had not had any prior impression
with respect to whether he had been a defector or an attempted defector?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think, yes; I had some impression of that sort, but it came
directly from Lee. He said he went to the Soviet Union and tried to give up
his American citizenship, and as I recall, he said that the American embassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
did not relinquish his passport, and, therefore, he was not eligible to get Soviet
citizenship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are remembering more now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am pleased that you are, Mrs. Paine. He did discuss his attempts
to <span class="locked">obtain&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To surrender his passport and to accomplish his Soviet citizenship?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was openly discussed in this gathering?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. This is Senator Cooper, a member of the Commission, Mrs.
Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. How do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This party, I gather, lasted approximately from 7 to 12, did you
say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Eight to eleven-thirty or twelve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the party broke up, and you went home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your overall impression of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had very little impression altogether. I did ask for her
address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I asked if I could write her. I wanted to go visit her at her
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To talk Russian. She is very hard to find, a person speaking
modern Russian, and in fact I know of no other, and this was an opportunity for
me to again practice in the language, a rather unusual opportunity, and I was
interested in meeting her and getting to know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I will go back and develop this lady's interest in
the Russian language during the course of the examination, and her prior study
of the language up to this point. She did have an abiding interest in the language
at this particular point, but I wanted to get at the initial meeting first
before anything further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say modern Russian, that Marina Oswald had a command of
modern Russian. Would you please explain to us what you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I am not in a position to judge a person, whether a person
is speaking modern Russian or not. My language is not that good, but she
talked with&mdash;this was later, I only assumed that she had&mdash;I hoped that she
spoke good Russian. I didn't know at that time whether she spoke educated
Russian or not. Shall I jump ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I wish you wouldn't. You meant, then, by your expression
that you hoped to find that she did speak educated Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if she did, that then you might profit or learn from her
educated Russian to a greater degree than you knew it as of that time? That
was your main interest at the moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Aside from interests in another lady or human being under
those circumstances?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, until I then got to know her it was my only interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. That is the point I was seeking to make. Did you become
better acquainted with the Oswalds thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I <span class="locked">met&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you, first, yes or no?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I became better acquainted with Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, if members of the Commission&mdash;I am going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
pass from this initial event&mdash;if you have any questions you would like to put
to the witness now rather than my deferring it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Are there any questions?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Not for me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not at this point.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask one? Did Oswald, Lee Oswald on this occasion
express any dislike for any elements or aspects of American society?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall anything specific that was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. He did not indicate to this group why it was that he left
the United States to go to Russia originally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is hard to say how I formed this opinion, but I gathered
that he disapproved of the economic system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Was there anything more specific than that that he referred
to? Did he refer, for example, to any dislike of individuals?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Individuals? No; I am certain there was none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. In government or out of government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Your impression was that he was motivated to go to the Soviet
Union because he didn't like the capitalist system?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And had an affinity for what might be called the Marxist
system, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is all the questions that I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Along those lines, Mrs. Paine, did he make any remarks with
respect to workers in Russia as compared with the position, the economic
position of workers in America? Did he refer to workers as a subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am trying to refresh your recollection. You said economics,
he thought that the economic situation was superior in Russia. I wonder
whether he related it to the ordinary worker rather than the overall system.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How well did Marina speak English at the time you
made the first acquaintance or first contact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was under the impression she spoke no English at all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she appear to understand any English at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe she understood much of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your definite impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear her speak any English words that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Senator Cooper?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I believe you said a few minutes ago that you were interested
in knowing why Lee Oswald left the United States and went to Russia.
Did you say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I don't recall saying it. I suppose I was curious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I don't recall that she actually said that. She said it was an
interesting situation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was unusual, I think I probably said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. She used the word unusual.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. An unusual thing to do, certainly.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I don't want to say that you said something you didn't, but
I got the impression that one of the reasons you were interested in meeting
this family was in fact that this man had left the United States and gone to
Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. In some sense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not in any sense whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. As I recall it she did say that this was an unusual situation,
and that to some extent developed your interest. This is Mr. Dulles, a member
of the Commission.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Maybe I could put it this way. Perhaps we could read back
and find out, but I thought that you intimated or indicated that you were interested
in the fact that this man had gone to Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Perhaps I can answer your <span class="locked">question&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And it provoked your interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can answer it this way. I was interested at the party to hear
something of what he had to say. I was hopeful when I wrote and inquired if
I could see Marina where they lived; and knowing that he would be at work,
that I would try to go during the week when I would have a chance simply to
talk with her.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That night he did say that he did not like the capitalist
system?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were you interested, then, in finding out what it was about
it he didn't like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. In reference to his experience in Russia or for any other
reason?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You didn't inquire further to have him elaborate on his reasons
for not liking the capitalist system?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. Of course, it is a rather short space of time we are talking
about, perhaps 45 minutes or so or less. People were inquiring of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But others did inquire on these subjects?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For the most part the other people asked questions, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the subject that Senator Cooper has inquired about, is that
true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now perhaps to help your recollection a little bit on that, was
this roommate of whom you speak named Volkmar Schmidt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Volkmar sounds familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall a couple by the name of Richard Pierce, or a
gentleman at least by the name of Richard Pierce who attended that meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that would be the other roommate, not a couple, he was
single, Richard Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there not present a Miss Betty MacDonald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which I had completely forgotten about, yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you still are unable to recall the name of the other couple?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am unable to. Betty MacDonald I do recall lives in the same
apartment building as this couple, and it is a long German sort of name, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you become acquainted with Mr. Glover through your
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, you might say so. We both became interested in going to
madrigal sings at the same time. My interest in madrigals was developed by
Michael, but that was before we ever moved to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you teaching Russian at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were not? Had you done any teaching of Russian prior to
this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You subsequently did some teaching; have you done some teaching
of Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just this past summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. I will get to that in due course. Did you do some translating
that evening for Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I spoke to her very little. I was embarrassed to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Because my Russian was so poor, and the De Mohrenschildts
could both do it all so much better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Mr. Oswald's command of Russian very good, also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't hear him speak Russian that night at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, is that so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He may have, but I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did no translating?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. For her, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For Marina. And on no occasion&mdash;he sat there and on none
of the occasions did he translate, but, rather, Mr. De Mohrenschildt did the
translating?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't even believe that was translating. They would address
themselves to her in a separate conversation from what was going on from these
three or four around him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that those who did not understand Russian got nothing
from it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Those who did not understand English got nothing from what
he was saying&mdash;is that what you mean, or do you mean the other way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If no one interpreted her in English, translated for her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No one understood it; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then whose who didn't understand <span class="locked">Russian&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did not understand what she was saying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that went on through the entire evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You must understand she was not present for, I would say, more
than half of the evening. She was just with her child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But while she was present.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no translation done for her benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or for the benefit of anybody else who did not understand
Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The other way; no. It is a long time ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes. Was anything the subject that evening of Mrs. Oswald's
family background? Was that discussed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of Marina's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not discussed at anytime during that evening, the fact
that she was in Russia, she had been educated as, and was, a pharmacist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That might have been said. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your reaction to the De Mohrenschildts that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had heard from Everett that they were interesting people,
that they had gone on a hiking tour through Mexico taking pictures as they
went. I learned or had known from Everett, also, in this one telephone conversation,
that he was a geologist, a free lancer.</p>

<p>Mrs. De Mohrenschildt seemed somewhat protective toward Marina in the
sense of wanting her to understand what was&mdash;wanting to talk with her,
to include her. Mr. De Mohrenschildt talked about his past life some in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His speaking of his past life was in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was in English. I recalled to him his first wife who was also
a Quaker. I remember he said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was your next contact with either Marina Oswald or
Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote a letter, a note to Marina at the address I had been given,
and got a note back saying, "We have moved. This is the new address. Come in
perhaps a week." From that time. She wanted to get the house cleaned up
before I came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They lived in Dallas, did they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was in Dallas; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On this February 22 occasion they were then living on Neely
Street in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe they moved just in that period that I had the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
address, and as soon as I wrote, the first letter I got back gave the Neely Street
address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have recorded that, have you not, in your address book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which I will follow up in a moment. Do you have a copy of
the letter that you wrote to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. That initial letter asking if I could come over? I don't
believe I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not <span class="locked">having&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have her reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do have a reply?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have her reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have it with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She drew a map. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I have it, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do you want it right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. Wait&mdash;no; perhaps I have it at the hotel. I don't
think it is here. I didn't think I would be before the Commission today at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will pass that. You can get it tonight.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I am certain I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was written in Russian, I assume.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; in my letter to her, bad Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As long as you have the letter I don't want you to attempt to
summarize it then, but you did write her a note in which you sought to come
see her. She responded advising you of a change of address. There would
be some delay, I gather, because she wished to get her home in order, having
just moved. And this exchange of letters took place approximately when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was early March some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think her letter is postmarked the 8th of March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After that exchange of letters, did you see Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you go to her home or did she come to yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I drove to her home. There would be no way for her to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had another exchange of letters before you went to
her home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just waited a few days, guessed how long it would take
her to have her home in order, and you visited her, am I correct in my summary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She suggested Tuesday, as I recall in her letter, but what Tuesday
I don't know. If it was written the 8th that would be Tuesday the 12th.
There is no notation on my calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have her response to your letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is what I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the hotel. We will get that this evening. Was Mr. Oswald
home when you visited her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the next occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make a description in your calendar with respect to this
visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I judge not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you find any in your calendar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With respect to this visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, that calendar is all in your handwriting, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Exhibit No. 401 the document
that has been given that exhibit number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 401, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What time of day was this visit, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was midmorning, up to lunchtime. She had hoped I could
stay through lunch but I wanted to get back so my children could have naps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there anybody at home to care for your children when
you made this visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I took them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, you took them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Therefore, I wanted to get them home to take naps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the driving time from your home in <span class="locked">Irving&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Thirty-five to forty minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the Neely Street address of the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it&mdash;or was Mr. Oswald home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just Marina? And that visit&mdash;tell us about that visit, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I fear my recollection may meld one or two visits that occurred
in March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It might be a good idea, then,&mdash;go ahead and tell us about them
in a melded form.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. I recall we walked out to a nearby park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In both cases?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You think so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Anyway, I recall walking to the park, and I think this was the
first visit, and we sat and talked. It was warm weather, March, in Dallas.
And the children played on the park equipment, and we talked, and she told
me that she was expecting a baby, and asked me not to talk about it among
the Russian community.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Had anything been said on that subject when you
first met Marina Oswald the night of February 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing? This was your first notice of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she told you not&mdash;would you repeat that, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She told me that she was expecting a child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She told you not to do what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to tell members of the Russian-speaking community in
Dallas. She preferred for it not to be publicly known, so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you in contact with the Russian-speaking community in
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say that to her on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it is a contact I could have had. It was reasonable for
her to assume I might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you said nothing in response to that. Did you reassure
her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I just said I wouldn't talk about it, that it was up to her to
make such an announcement when she felt like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask a question at this point?</p>

<p>You said Lee Oswald was not there. A little earlier in your testimony you
said you hoped he would not be there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Why did you say that? Was it because you took any dislike to
his being there or was it merely because you wanted exclusive contact with
Marina, or both?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I certainly wanted to make the contact with Marina. She had
not appeared as a person at all at the party. I couldn't tell what sort of person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
she was, and I felt meeting alone with her would make an opportunity both to
speak the language and to find out what sort of person she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Go on. Did you have any further motivation for that wish?
Did you take any dislike to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not an active dislike, but I didn't like him. I think we can
say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you gathered that impression the evening of February 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is very hard to know whether I gathered it then or in terms
of things she told me then after we met, and I will outline them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; we will get into those.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say it was more formed later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in your responding to Mr. McCloy's question you were attempting
to transport yourself back to that particular occasion and not be
affected by the course of events that had taken place in the meantime, am I
correct about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I tried to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your ability. Tell us a little more, then, to the
extent you have a recollection what occurred and what was said in the park
on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I recall that we talked, and, as I said, it may be the first
visit or it may have been the first and the second melded in my mind. She said
that she was expecting a baby. She said that Lee didn't want her to learn
English. He was not encouraging her to learn English or helping her with it,
that he spoke only Russian to her and to their baby June. And she told me&mdash;now,
let me say that my calendar does show a notation on the 20th of March,
it says, "Marina" and I judge I went again to see her at her home on that day,
or brought her to my house, I am not certain which. But I judge, also, that
this was the second visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I suggest that you might have melded these a moment ago. Now
I wish you would keep these apart for the moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So far as I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And stick with the occasion in the park first and exhaust your
recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I was impressed, talking with her in the park, with what
I felt to be her need to have a friend. This was virtually our first meeting,
but she confided to me something that she didn't want generally known among
the Russian segment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was her pregnancy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of Dallas. She inquired of me, a young woman, about birth
control methods, and she said that she felt&mdash;well, clearly this pregnancy had
surprised her, but she said that she didn't believe in abortion, and didn't want to
consider such a course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you exhausted your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all I recall; yes.</p>

<p>I do not recall whether it was this time or the next time, it may well have
been the next time, that she told me <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to stick with this. When Mrs. Oswald, this is your
first visit, she related to you and said that her husband did not wish her to
acquire any command of the English language, what did you say? Did you
express yourself in some fashion as to why? Didn't that seem curious to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I likely said <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is best you don't guess.</p>

<p>Give us your best recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that she did most of the talking because
she could. My Russian was bad enough that if she talked I was happy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you feel any embarrassment because you <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, a terrible embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a terrible impediment to talking and to friendship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish you would elaborate on that because I am sure the members
of the Commission would like to have your mental reaction to what you
thought was your limited command of the Russian language and whether it
interfered with communication between you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It interfered very markedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you elaborate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I could think of many more things to say than I could think of
the words to use in order to say it in Russian. I want to keep jumping ahead
to illustrate this. But just it was very difficult for me to communicate.</p>

<p>I understand much more readily than I speak, so that I could understand
what she was saying to me easily, especially as she took care to see that she used
small words and made herself understood.</p>

<p>But it was very difficult for me just to speak. I could not possibly have reacted
to her as I would to someone else in English, as I would if she had been
speaking English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At this time you felt that she could not gain very much if you
talked to her in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was certain of that, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But later she had improved, apparently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After the assassination, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I never knew her to speak English at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or to understand?</p>

<p>I wasn't speaking of just speaking, but about the comprehension of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she said to me in November that she has changed from
never listening to an English conversation to giving it some of her attention
because she is able to pick up some words. You know how if you don't understand
anything there is no point <span class="locked">even&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I personally got the impression when she was here that she
understood a good deal of English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe she does, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But this time she did not have that facility at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you not think it was curious that her husband was adverse
to her acquiring some facility with the English language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought it was distinctly thoughtless on his part, even cruel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss it with her to the extent that you could in your
limited command of Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think the easiest thing was to agree with what she was saying
about it, agree with what she was saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which was what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which is that this wasn't the way it should be and I certainly
agreed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She complained, did she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She complained, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Did she express an interest, then, in acquiring some
facility?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not against his wishes, no. She didn't express an interest. In
learning English through me, for instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. She showed no interest unlike the interest you had in her
helping you with Russian, she showed no interest at that moment in learning
from you some command of the English language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you think the second occasion occurring in your calendar
entry there was possibly March 20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what is the entry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It says, "Marina".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the only word?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all it says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In that square?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably I went again to her home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Does that refresh your recollection as to anything on
that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It does not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am guessing, again, that this was the second meeting. I think
I went to her home twice before I carried her from her place to my home, which
was considerably more of an event, since it was 35 or 40 minutes each way,
going twice in one day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say carry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Carry, that is a good Texas term for driving a person in a car.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I must say there, that is an old term even in Kentucky. You
take some person some place you carry them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You carry them; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is an odd expression to me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have been in Texas longer than I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it then there were two occasions when you visited her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe there were two down there, and then I asked her, went to
pick her up and brought her to my home and we spent a portion of the day at
my home, and I then took her back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was at your invitation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you by this time&mdash;let us take the March 20 affair, occasion&mdash;had
you some feeling of affinity or liking for Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did feel that she was in a difficult position from the first I met
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, chronologically, would you in your own words, so that I
don't suggest anything to you, what was the next occasion?</p>

<p>The next time it was under circumstances in which you went to her home in
your station wagon, picked her up and brought her to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was probably then that she mentioned to me that Lee wanted
her to go back to the Soviet Union, was asking her to go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He mentioned this subject as early as that, did he not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was still in March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did, yes; and said that she didn't want to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Commission is interested in that. Would you please relate it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said she did not want to go back, that he asked her to go
back, told her, perhaps, to go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. State just as <span class="locked">accurately&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As she described it I <span class="locked">felt&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just what she said now, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He told her he wanted to send her back with June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the Soviet Union. As she described it, I judged that <span class="locked">meant&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Please&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A <span class="locked">divorce&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Instead of saying as she described it tell us what she said, if you
can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said that she had written to the Soviet Embassy to ask about
papers to go back, and received a reply from them saying, "Why do you want
to go back?" And she said she just didn't answer that letter because she didn't
want to go back, and that that was where the matter stood at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She had not answered the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The inquiry from the Embassy. She did not answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she say whether or not she showed that answer from the
Soviet Embassy to her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did I understand you to say that Marina said to you that she
thought that meant a divorce?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will state again that she felt she was being sent back to stay
back, that he would stay here, that this amounted to the end of the marriage
for them, but not legally done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. And did she express any opinion of opposition to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She particularly was opposed to going back. It was leaving the
United States that she was opposed to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She wanted to stay here, did she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I ask you this general question, then, Mrs. Paine: During all
of your contact with Marina Oswald, did she ever express any view other than
that one of wanting to remain in America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she? Was she affirmative about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of wanting to stay in this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what did you say when she related that her husband
wanted her to return to Russia, and she thought to remain in Russia. Did it
elicit some curiosity from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Curiosity? It elicited anger at Lee that he would presume to
drop his responsibilities so preemptorily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss it with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote a letter to her in an effort to gather my words. I couldn't
just discuss it with her. My language was not that good. What I wanted to do
was offer her an alternative to being sent back, an economic alternative, and
I thought for some time and thought over a week about inviting her to live
with me. I was alone with my two children at the time, as an alternative to
being sent back. If he thought he couldn't support her or didn't care to or
whatever reason he had, I simply wanted to say there was an alternative to her
going back, that she could stay and live with me if she wanted to. I wrote such
a letter, really, to <span class="locked">gather&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do. This letter was never sent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that also at the hotel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know. It may be here. I can look if you want. This
letter was never sent and never mentioned to her. I wrote it so that I would
have the words before me to use if it seemed appropriate to me to make the
invitation, you see, a way of gathering enough of the language, enough Russian,
and to say what I wanted to say. And this letter is dated the 7th of April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 7th of April?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I know I spent at least a week thinking about it. I talked
it over with Michael before I wrote it, and it is plainly marked "never sent"
on the letter. I carried it with me, as I recall I carried it once to the apartment
so that <span class="locked">if&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To what apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To their apartment on Neely Street, so that if it seemed appropriate
I could hand it to her, you see. I could make this invitation at home
with time and a dictionary in hand, and then let her read it. It was ever so
much easier than just trying to say it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Though you never delivered it, did you ever speak from it to
her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When she was staying with me the last few days of April and
the first week of May, I made, yes, a verbal invitation of that sort, and in the
April 7 letter, I have just gone over this correspondence or I wouldn't recall
what it said, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine. I think we can take the time to see if
you have the letter in your bag.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am sorry that I feel precipitated into a discussion of this correspondence,
and I would rather&mdash;no, it is not here&mdash;go at it&mdash;there are several
things I want to say about it. I began to mention it to Mr. Jenner this morning
and thought we would have a whole afternoon to talk more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will have time tonight, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You will have time tonight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought Mr. Redlich might look at the letter. I didn't want
to delay the Commission. You do have it at hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is not here. It is at the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to return to something else for the moment, then,
first.</p>

<p>What reasons did Marina give, if she gave any, as to why her husband wished
her to return to Russia? What did she say on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No explanation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I meant by that last question to imply that there might have been
another occasion subsequently in which the subject was discussed again in
which she did state what Mr. Oswald's reasons were, if any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She never stated any reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Never?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She implied that it was because he didn't want her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Want her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the date of this letter, April 7?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. We will take a brief recess.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you turn to your calendar, please. What is the next
day, date, in your calendar, in which you have an entry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Regarding the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Regarding the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is April 2, Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the entry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "Marina and Lee dinner."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, I take it that by this time, that is, up to April 2
you had had several visits with Marina and you had reached the point at which
you invited them to your home for dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Now, Michael had never met either. By this time I had
talked to him. I had indeed invited them to stay indefinitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And so I wanted him to meet them and invited them both to
come to dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine, if I seem presumptuous.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you have stated several times, and now you state you inquired
of your husband as to whether you could invite Marina to stay with you.
Didn't you think that was a little presumptuous on your part to invite a man's
wife to come to live with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, toward Lee it was presumptuous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Beg pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Presumptuous in relation to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In relation to Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed it is. Well, I will have to refer again to the letter of
April 7 where I said I didn't want to hurt Lee by such an invitation, but that
if they were unhappy, if their marital situation was similar to mine, and this
is not specifically in the letter, but if he just did not want to live with her, that
I would have offered this as an alternative, really to both of them. I didn't
want to get into a position of competition with Lee for his wife. I thought
about that, and thought he might be very offended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is possible he might very well be.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it is possible he even might have been violent, but I didn't
think anything about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any impression of him up to this moment on this
score?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a man of temper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Violence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I had met him once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You invited the Oswalds to dinner on the evening of April 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What day of the week was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anything occur that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, Michael picked them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Michael picked them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the Neely Street address. Has he talked about that? It
didn't come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't know. I haven't the slightest notion. I was talking
with you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Should I go ahead? I just want to get this first impression into
the record somewhere if he hasn't already.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think it would be helpful if you gave your impression
of his impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of his impression.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. This I have learned since the assassination, he didn't
give me this impression as at the time we didn't talk that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, you are not giving us your impression of his impression
on this occasion, but rather your impression of what he said to you after the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You still want it?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think it is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Let us hear it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said&mdash;you must understand, that not living together we talked
together very little. I am sure he would have given me his impression if we
had been having dinner together the next day afterwards, you see. He went
over and Marina was not yet ready. He thought that Lee was somewhat
thoughtless. While doing absolutely nothing to help her get ready, get the
baby's things together, prepare himself, he was quite impatient, thought she
should be ready, and gave orders while he himself sat down and talked to
Michael, and Michael carried the impression that Lee was somewhat thoughtless.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did you do? That was about a half hour&mdash;what did you
do during that period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was at the house preparing the dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were at home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It has to be my impression of his impressions. I don't
recall the evening too well, the evening of the second. I do recall we certainly
had dinner together. I can't recall what the predominant language was. Lee
and Michael, of course, talked in English. Not wanting to exclude her entirely
from the conversation, I made opportunity to talk with her in Russian after
the meal was over. She and I did the dishes and talked in Russian, and we
were in the kitchen while Michael was talking to Lee in English in the living
room, so I do not know what was said then between the two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did your husband get along with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, you probably have something on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression? I want your impression of how
your husband got along.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Okay. He was initially very interested in learning what sort
of man this was who had taken such a dramatic and unusual step to go to
the Soviet Union and attempt to renounce his citizenship. He thought here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
is a person that must have thought things out for himself, a very individualistic
person, not a follower of the masses, and he wanted to hear what the ideology
was that led Lee to this step.</p>

<p>Michael has told me that he very soon felt that there wasn't much ideology
or thought, foundation. That Michael had thought he might be able to learn
from this man something and find at least good thinking going on or inquiry,
but he didn't find it. He rather found very rigid adherence to a few principles
such as the principle of the capitalist exploiting the worker, and that this was a
great moral failing of the capitalistic society. Michael's own feeling was that
Lee's view of morality was very different from Michael's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what respect, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Michael recalls having&mdash;now, this is later. This is not that
evening. Did you expect it was? This is answering your question of Michael's
impression of Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wanted his initial impression.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All initial impressions. Well, I have passed that. I have gone
considerably past it, in fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. How many times had you seen Marina up to this moment,
that is, up to April 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was two or three times besides the initial party in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your best recollection is that this was a nice, pleasant
evening, and that was about all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your husband take the Oswald's home that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the second. When was the next occasion that you had
contact with either of the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is a notation of the eighth of April. I am looking on
my calendar, I have no other way of knowing, and one also on the tenth which
has an arrow going to the eleventh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to ask you a little bit about that before you go
into it. Would you describe for the Commission now the condition, the physical
condition, of your calendar there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Physical?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. There is a square, and in the square there is written
something.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "Marina" is written this time in Russian. I am improving, it
seems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Russian. It is in the square dated April 10.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am talking now about the square on April 8. There is a
notation "Marina".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that all there is in that square?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all that is in that square.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then the only thing that appears in the square for April 10
is the name "Marina" in Russian, and an arrow pointing, an arrow from it
pointing, to April 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, go back, if you will, to April 8.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that refresh your recollection or stimulate you as to whether
you had any contact with Marina on that day or whether it was prearranged
and what the occasion was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Certainly, it says that there had been an arrangement to get
together. Whether we did I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought you had read everything that appeared in that square.
Is there more than just the word "Marina" in the square?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is my recollection. But that refreshes your recollection
in turning that, that was a prearranged meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, all of these were, since there was no way over the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your recollection sufficiently refreshed to state whether the
meeting was a visit by you to her or she to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does it have a relation to the letter that you say that you prepared
dated April 7, which is the day before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might have taken it that day, I don't know. Yes; it is entirely
possible. I hadn't thought about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But anyhow my mentioning those two events together, does that
refresh your recollection or stimulate it more specifically on the subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It does not. You have no recollection beyond the fact that on
April 8 you have an entry with the word "Marina." Is that written in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The word "Marina" in Russian, it doesn't stimulate you in any
respect, does not stimulate your recollection?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At the time of the dinner at your home on April 2,
following that or during that time, do you recollect any discussion about General
Walker between your husband and Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't recollect any such discussion.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If there was any it would have had to have been in the living
room while I was talking to Marina in Russian in the kitchen. I didn't hear
any reference to it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You didn't hear any discussion that evening between
your husband and Lee Oswald about General Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did your husband ever tell you subsequently of any
such discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall it. There was one reference, but that was later.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was later. Do you recall when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It would be the Friday after U.N. Day, October the 4th.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was October 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And this was April 2d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall any discussion of General Walker at all with
Marina or in the presence of Marina or with Lee Oswald or in his presence
in your home or their home or even out in the parkway on the subject of General
Walker up to April 11, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any discussion between yourself and your husband on that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; none that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you subscribe to a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At that time I subscribed to the Irving local paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that an evening or a morning paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At that time it was a morning paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Morning paper. Do you have a recollection of being aware in the
edition of April 11 of an attack on General Walker the night before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is more likely that I heard it on television. I think I must
have heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a television and a radio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We get news from the television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were aware of the attack on General Walker the evening
of April 10. Did you see Marina Oswald on the 11th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can only guess so judging from these marks on my calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We would like your very best recollection, please, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall; I just don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just don't have any present recollection that you did see
her on the 11th or you didn't? You just have no&mdash;you are blank?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can only guess from the calendar, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that entry you have no recollection whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If you had seen her would it have been at her house, at her
apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't even know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Wouldn't you have remembered four trips back and forth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember that I made such trips, but which day it is, it is very
difficult to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see. But you think&mdash;have you had a recollection about seeing
her at this time, without pinpointing it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion between you and Marina on the subject
of the General Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am trying to recall now when she first told me that Lee was out
of work. The next note I have of having seen them, and you must understand
this calendar by no means tells everything I have done or would even be accurate
about what I have done on account of what has happened, but at some point
she told me that he was out of work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it some point near the time we are now discussing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Near the time we are now discussing. I am trying to get some
content in order to answer the question of what happened, did I see her, what
happened. The next date I have down for seeing her is a picnic on the 20th of
April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had she told <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall it having been that long, but it probably was, between
the 11th and the picnic. It was before the picnic she told that he was out
of work and had been for a few days before he told her.</p>

<p>Now, you probably know when he was out of work, but I don't, when he lost
his job. So I am judging that possibly this was mentioned on the 11th that he
was out of work, because we did plan to have a picnic on the 20th which
included Lee, but it could have been even that day that she told me that he was
out of work and had been for some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any day on or about this time, the 10th or 11th or
12th, within those 3 days, that you saw Marina, where your attention was
arrested by her being upset or disturbed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any fashion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I notice in your calendar and entry April 16, "St. Marks
open again 12 noon." Is that the school your children attend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, they are both preschool age. It must have been an Easter&mdash;my
children are preschool age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the occasion of your making that entry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I probably wanted to visit the class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What class?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A language class. This is a school at which I subsequently
taught. Last summer I taught at St. Marks School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were visiting the class in advance of your teaching?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So I probably wanted to visit&mdash;no, just any language class there,
and inquired, I judge, you see, you will find on Good Friday no school, too, the
12th. So I was marking when the Easter vacation was for St. Marks in order
to make plans sometime later to go and visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Would you return to April 2, that dinner. Is that
entry "dinner at 8"? I couldn't quite figure <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe that is the 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Seven. Was anything said that night about Lee Oswald's work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About his job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I asked him how could I reach them if I had to call off a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
get-together. I had no way of telephoning Marina. If the child got sick how
would I tell her I am not coming. So I said could I have his telephone at work
in order to reach them through him if I felt it necessary some time, and he
wrote down for me the address and telephone number of the place where he
worked. This was on the 2d of April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that, I will turn to that, if I might, and that will be Commission
Exhibit 402, and we have a like photograph of the exhibit. Is all of
that exhibit in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I have just said he wrote down Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is one entry that is in his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give us the letter page of that, will you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The letter page, "O" for Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "O" for Oswald. The entry Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall was written
by Mr. Oswald; all other entries on that page are in your handwriting; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are all other entries in the entire address book in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did we go over it? What did I say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, we did this morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would guess so. I don't recall. Did we say so this morning?
I will have to look it over again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not permitted to testify, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. You want me to look right now? I usually write the
addresses down myself, so it would be quite unusual for someone else to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this address book in the same condition now as it was when
you gave it to the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not give it to the police, they took it, and I didn't know it
was gone until later that day. It is in the same condition except it has been
through the finger-printing process.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am particularly <span class="locked">interested&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is all in my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am particularly interested in the entries on the page lettered
"O," and I want to especially ask you whether that page is in the same condition
now as it was when it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask the witness why there are certain lines half horizontal,
half perpendicular there, certain of these?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It means it is an old address, no longer applicable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Dulles, you were referring to the page lettered "O"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is correct; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I had digressed or interrupted at that point because you, for the
first time, made reference to an entry in your address book made by Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence the document identified as Exhibit 401.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Where is <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 402 rather. That is the address book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 402 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were relating that you inquired as to how you could
reach them if you had to reach them, and Mr. Lee Oswald <span class="locked">wrote&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His work, the name of the company and the telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it they did not have a telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They did not; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they ever have a telephone even when they were in New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When they came back again to Dallas, they did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They did not.</p>

<p>(At this point in the proceedings Senator Cooper left the Commission hearing
room.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was the April 2d occasion the second time that you had
seen <span class="locked">Lee&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald? You had not seen him in the interim?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When next did you see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I next saw him on the 20th of April at a picnic at a park near
where they lived on Neely Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In between certainly the 2d of April and, possibly, in that period
from the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th, let us take that period up, until the time of
the 20th, did you see Marina Oswald in between?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did you say between the <span class="locked">2d&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Between the 8th and 10th through the 20th.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess not; between the 11th or so and the 20th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So far as I know, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you communicate with her about the picnic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably by letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By a letter. Do you have that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have&mdash;I don't know if I have it. I have a letter that closes
"October 20th" in my hand, a scratch note.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could I look at that correspondence this evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Then the next occasion was when you had the picnic on the 20th, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I notice in that entry what looks to me like "Miss Mary 7:15."
What is the significance of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is probably going out in the evening. It had no relationship
with the picnic at all. It has a relationship with a dinner group which
is at the time, you see the line "dinner group&mdash;7:15 Miss Mary," who is a
babysitter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That entry has nothing to do with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without elaborating, please, Mrs. Paine, what would the subjects
of discussion between you and Marina and Mr. Oswald have been at
the picnic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the picnic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He spent most of his time fishing. We saw almost nothing of
him and heard virtually nothing from him. I was impressed with his unwillingness
to be sociable really in this situation. He came to eat when it was
time to, and complained about the food.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he complain about the food?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your husband present at this picnic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you supply the food?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; Marina had cooked it. He complained about it. He caught
a fish, as I recall, and took it home to be cleaned. I hardly know who would
clean it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who did clean it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know. I left about that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What discussion occurred between you and Lee Oswald, if
any, with respect to his life in Russia on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any conversation with him other than some
pleasantries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so. I can't even think of the pleasantry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As I understand it, as you were sitting there, the picnic took
place in the <span class="locked">park&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was way over at the lake fishing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was over fishing at the lake?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any further discussion occur between you and Marina on
that occasion, or on any interim occasion, of Mr. Oswald's desire to have her
return to Russia or the fact that she did not wish the Russian emigré group to
know she was pregnant and was about to have a child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically. I did feel that it wasn't a particularly
happy occasion. I don't recall it with lightness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he out of work at that time or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he was out of work. I knew at that time he was out of
work. Whether I found out that morning or the previous time I had seen her
I don't recall. I only recall when she said he was out of work she also said
he had been out of work for a week or a few days before he told her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to have you draw on your recollection as closely
as you can. Did you learn of his being out of work from him or from Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say on that subject as to whether he was discharged
or whether he had left his employment, or did she say anything in
that area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I judged he had been discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your best recollection of what she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do you want something else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your best recollection of what she said, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall it that closely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You next have an entry on April 24 reading "Lee and Marina."
Do you find it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that a meeting with Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife,
Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was that held?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was to be a visit at the apartment on Neely Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At their apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I arrived and found that he was packed to go to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a surprise to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was a distinct surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there been some communication between you and the
Oswalds about your visiting them on the 24th of April?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It had been arranged that I would come over to visit as much as
these other visits had been arranged, just with Marina to talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any visit with Marina between the 20th of April
and the 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you arranged on the 20th to visit on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time of day did you arrive, or night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mid-morning, perhaps around 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you found him packed or packing to leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was fully packed. I was evidently expected. I and my car,
because he asked if I could take these bags and duffel bags, suitcases, to the
bus station for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Where he would buy a ticket to go to New Orleans, and he said he
had not been able <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What he said to you is what I am interested in.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said he had not been able to find work in Dallas, around
Dallas, and Marina suggested going to New Orleans, which is where he had
been born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He said she had suggested?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. That is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina present now while he is relating this to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was present. Was he speaking in Russian or in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he must have been speaking in English when he asked
me to take the things to the bus station and explained that he was going to
look for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your best recollection is that this was in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. It could well have been in Russian also. He
didn't like to speak English to me. He preferred to speak Russian.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. To you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To me; yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he ever indicate why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you said to me this morning, and please correct me
if my recollection is not good, that he always spoke to you in Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With, perhaps, a couple of rare exceptions, yes, he spoke to me
in Russian. When I tried to teach him to drive I tried to explain to him,
proceeded to explain to him in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, you tried to teach him to do what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To drive. This is later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Drive, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But he would answer me in Russian, which is a way of getting
the person to go back to Russian. But I couldn't explain driving in Russian, so
I did it in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That incident, Mrs. Paine, is very important, and we will get
to that at a later stage as to your efforts to teach him to drive.</p>

<p>Going back to this 24th of April, there was here, this was, a complete surprise
to you. You arrived at the home and this man was all packed to go to
New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any discussion with Marina about her coming
to live with you of which she was aware prior to this occasion on April 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had discussed with her the possibility of her coming at the
time the baby was expected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the baby expected?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mid-October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there had been no discussion up to April 24, to your
recollection, even about your inviting Marina to come to live with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You mean on a more permanent basis, other than to stay when
the baby was due?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; which would be in the fall of the year.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. There was none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was no discussion about her coming to live with you
in the spring around about this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember feeling when I arrived that they were, and probably
appropriately, making their own plans, and wondering whether I should have
already made this invitation, but I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say they were already making their own plans; are you
seeking to imply that they had some notion she might join you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think there was any notion. I am trying to say
I recall that I hadn't made that invitation at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection it is now that you had not
discussed the subject with Marina up to this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not the subject of staying on with me as an alternative to going
back to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Only staying with you in the fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When the baby came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say, Mrs. Paine&mdash;excuse me. First, have you exhausted
your recollection of everything that Lee Oswald said on that occasion
when you arrived there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said, yes, I would take his bags to the station if he wanted me to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And we then did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Take them to the bus station to be checked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina accompany you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina went, and he checked the baggage. It was rather more
than he could have carried on the city bus, and I am sure he preferred me
to a taxi because I don't cost as much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't cost anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. And he then bought a ticket, he bought a ticket for
Marina, I mean I was thinking, while he was in the bus station, and suggested
that it would be a very difficult thing for a pregnant woman with a small child
to take a 12-hour, 13-hour bus trip to New Orleans, and suggested that I drive her
down with June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You volunteered this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I volunteered this, and suggested further that instead of her
staying at her&mdash;at the apartment, as was planned at that time, while waiting
to hear from him, that she come and stay at my house where he would reach
us by phone, and where she would have someone else with her while she waited
to hear if he got work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was the conversation between you and Lee Harvey Oswald?
Was it in English or in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably in Russian. I would think so, because I wanted her
to understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was present; I see.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This took place where, in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably in the bus station&mdash;in the car near the bus station.
He then took the bus ticket back, returned it, and got the money.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Ticket for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ticket for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Her bus ticket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and he left some money for her for buying things in the
next few days before she could join him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he get on the bus then and depart?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; the bus left in the evening. We all drove back to the apartment
after he had checked the baggage, and he helped load the baby things and
things that Marina would need during the next few days into my car, and we
emptied what was left there of the things that were in the apartment, and
which belonged to them, and then drove, I drove with Marina and June and my
two children back to my house, and he stayed at the apartment. He was
scheduled to leave by bus, city bus, and an interstate bus that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it then, Mrs. Paine, that your impression was that it was
contemplated, when you arrived at the Oswalds that morning, that Mrs. Oswald,
Marina, and her child June, and her husband, Lee, were contemplating going
to New Orleans together that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Am I wrong?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is wrong. She was to have stayed in the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And wait to hear from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If they had been going together that would not have been the
hardship on her, but that traveling alone was, I felt.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Why did he buy the ticket for her at <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To leave with her so that she could follow him when he called,
to leave the ticket in her hand as a means of her following him. I haven't
been clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a little indefinite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I thought the ticket had been redeemed; then he bought another
ticket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He bought a ticket for himself and a ticket for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You said, "I will take her," and then he redeemed the ticket for
her, and gave her the cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gave her some money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. But the ticket that he did buy for <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was to have been left with her.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Was for a subsequent date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For a subsequent date following.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was clear to you on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was scheduled to join him subsequently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was scheduled to join him subsequently if he did find work.
If he found no work there would have been no point to her making the trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this a discussion or is it your rationalization?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was clearly said she would stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am puzzled. I am puzzled, Mr. Jenner, about this ticket
business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A ticket was bought for her on the theory that she was going
with him first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is where I got off the track. He bought two tickets, then
why was the ticket redeemed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Because it was made clear by Mrs. Paine that she was going
to take Marina down in her own car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But only going to stay with you during the period until he got
work, hence she wouldn't need a ticket. You were going to drive her down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would drive her down all the way to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In either case it was planned to delay going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She would go down if he got work, but she would not need a
ticket if she stayed with you. Therefore, the ticket was redeemed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But I did not think of this or suggest it until after he had
already bought the ticket.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask this, Mrs. Paine? In the things that were
packed when you arrived, or things that were packed while you were <span class="locked">present&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing was packed while I was present. It was already packed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Everything was already packed by the time you got
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Were any of the things for Marina or Lee packed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were all packed. I don't understand your question. All
of the things he wanted to take with him to the bus station were already
packed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, in that group of things which were so packed,
were there things for Marina and Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I mean Marina and June, excuse me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Some of their things were among those things, yes, I judge
so, clothing. The things that remained were a crib, playpen, baby stroller, some
dishes, some clothing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The things you would not ordinarily take on a bus,
however.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it would be very difficult. That was another one of the
things that motivated me to suggest driving her down. I thought sending
these by train, with the risk of their getting strayed or&mdash;it would be difficult,
trying, for her to try to handle them, or convey them with her by bus&mdash;that
would have been worse.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But there were some things that were packed in the
things that Lee was going to take with him that would include <span class="locked">things&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That belonged <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To&mdash;to Marina and to June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would judge so simply by what remained. Surely it was not
the total sum of her clothing and June's clothing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Which could lead a person to the conclusion that at one
stage of their discussion Marina was going to accompany Lee to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not from the time I arrived.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From the station.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was clear she would stay up in the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to that time it appeared to you from what was in the <span class="locked">duffelbag&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he was carrying all he could to lighten her burden. In
other words, if and when she followed, he was carrying all he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Representative Ford is interested in this, Mrs. <span class="locked">Paine&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am puzzled, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you arrived at the Oswald apartment that morning, Lee
Oswald had duffelbags packed and <span class="locked">some&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Suitcases. He had in those suitcases and in the duffelbag
some of the apparel for Mrs.&mdash;Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of course, I did not see it. I have to guess what was in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, from your knowledge of the household and afterwards, this
was at least your impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That they must have included some of her things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Which, in turn, might lead to the inference that, therefore,
they contemplated at that moment from what he was taking that Marina was
ultimately to join him in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Was that your question?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Or even at one point in the process of packing, she
and June were going to accompany him to New Orleans on the bus.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't have that impression, no. No, he was going and happened
to stay with an aunt and uncle where he could live without much charge.
For her to come would have been quite a greater expense, and a risky one without
a job, nothing coming in, so he was hoping that he could stay with the
aunt and uncle while he looked, and then if he got remunerative work, get an
apartment and call her to come, too.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. If that is so, and let us assume that is <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It puzzles me that he went into the bus station and
bought two tickets, one for himself and one for her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. How would she get there?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, eventually she might have to go by bus. But
why should he at this time make an investment in a bus ticket when there was
no <span class="locked">certainty&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When she might follow? This is what puzzles me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Well, I can only guess about this. I judge from his having
done this that he certainly intended for her to follow, and it is also possible
she couldn't have asked for a bus ticket herself. If he had written her and
said, "Don't come to New Orleans, come to Nashville," and he had said, "That
is where I have got my job," he might have felt she would not know how to
go and get such a bus ticket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is it also possible he may not have wanted to leave that amount
of money with her to buy a ticket and preferred to leave her a ticket rather
than cash?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is possible, this is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Paine, in light of that speculation, tell us what discussion there
was on the subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I have, that while he was in the bus station I thought
how difficult it would be for her to travel alone with the baby, and all the
<span class="locked">things&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you raised that yourself for the first time at that point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then I said she might stay with me while waiting to hear from
him, and that I would drive her down if we did hear that he had gotten work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there been prior discussion that it was contemplated that,
if he obtained a position, she would join him in New Orleans, or wherever he
obtained a position.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. We had already talked about that at the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that had been discussed with her present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And discussed in Russian so that she could have understood the
discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, the staff is interested in Lee Harvey Oswald's
luggage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His luggage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Luggage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please, to the best of your recollection, tell us what
pieces of luggage he had on that occasion, what they looked like, their shape
and form?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. He had two large marine duffelbags with his name on
them, and probably his Marine serial number. It was marked with a good
deal of white paint. It stood quite high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they up-ended when you say high? You mean standing
on end, they were high?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Standing on their end they would come well above this table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. About 40 inches?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Something like that; I would guess so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, I am interested in just that. Would you go over
to the drawing board and move your hand, judge from the floor, and stop right
there? We will measure that later.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Understand I saw those two later in my garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand, and I will get to that. That is just about 45 inches,
and there were two of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There were two of them. Do you want anything about the rest
of the luggage? Does that interest you the most?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I am interested, and I would like to stick with the duffelbags
for a moment. Was there any appearance as to either duffelbag, which, to
you, would indicate some long, slim, <span class="locked">hard&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I assume them to be both full of clothes, very rounded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't wish to be persistent, but was there anything that you
saw about the duffelbags that lead you at that time to even think for an instant
that there was anything long, slim and hard like a pole?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or a gun, a rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No? Nothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing. I did not move these bags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the extent you saw them is all I am inquiring about. You
did not touch them, you did not lift them, but you saw them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There appeared&mdash;the entire circumference of these bags which
you could see was smooth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, smooth, bumpy, but irregular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But no stick, no hard surface. Now, what about the diameter
of these bags, these duffelbags, what would you say it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. About like this, 15, 18, 20 inches across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Eighteen, twenty inches across?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is 15 inches.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. About like this; a little more than 15, probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 18 inches. Now, how many pieces of luggage in addition
to the two duffelbags?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Quite a few. There were probably three suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Three suitcases?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or more. A small radio bought in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to stick with the luggage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Three suitcases?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so, two or three, and a large softsided suitcase, I don't
know what to call it. It zips around the side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Zipper case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, made of canvas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We would like to have you describe that zipper case.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is <span class="locked">green&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am interrupting you, I am sorry. Were there any other pieces
of luggage, first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So there were two or three or possibly four, is that true, suitcases?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there was a zipper case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe this zipper case to us first.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It stood about so high [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So high is 15 inches, about 30 inches long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not quite, about that long [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a generous sized zipper case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. With generally green canvas and leather, dark-colored
leather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Black or brown&mdash;do you remember the color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Dark brown, I guess, or black, certainly very dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a generous sized one, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it appear to be well packed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe each of the three suitcases now, with particular
reference to the staff being interested in whether they were rectangular,
whether they were hard boarded types of things, or whether they were canvas
or soft?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember how many there were. I recall they had a
hard composition kind of suitcase such as you don't buy here, and I judge they
were bought in the Soviet Union. I think there may have been two of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was any one of them rectangular in shape?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. That was rectangular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The one you specifically have in mind, he did have a rectangular
one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what color was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Dark, blackish green, or dark brown, something of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else you can think about it in the way of description?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it had&mdash;it was reinforced, corners, with rivets, or bolts,
of something to hold it, hold the corners on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How long was this rectangular suitcase?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. In fact, I can't recall whether it was one or two,
but something like that, normal suitcases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have your permission to approach the
witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And take the measurements?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And take the measurements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The witness may be approached.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That or larger, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now describing the length of the rectangular suitcase,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that would be 21½ inches?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am brief in my recollection, a normal rectangular shape here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Width, that is the side, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the whole thing. That is looking at the top. How high
it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; wide.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am filling it out. This would be the width then from here to
here, possibly more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fourteen inches?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not sure I am recalling one or two at the same time. I have
to be under oath, and giving you details on things I don't recall that well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All we are seeking is your best recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right, that is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Twenty-one and a half times fourteen, and how high was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. About so, 6, about 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I said high. Was this lying flat on its side when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, all these things again I saw in the fall, so it is a mixed
recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am going to get as to what you saw in the fall, but it is important
to us as to what you saw on this occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I particularly recall the duffels because they are unusual,
and I recall this bag being, I judge Russian make rather than American, it
was a large zipper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mrs. Paine, you do recall that zipper bag on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there was at least one, if not more than one, <span class="locked">rectangular&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't be certain of the zipper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hard-sided suitcase?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; hard-sided suitcase. I can't be certain, absolutely certain,
of the zipper bag. I recall seeing so much of it since, tripped over it numerous
times, that it may be just that I recalled it. I didn't move this luggage at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not suggesting that you did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am sorry I can't remember it better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were all of these suitcases about the same size and shape?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have described the rectangular one. Would you now describe
the second, the second in order of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, there was at least another rectangular one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hard-sided?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it larger or smaller than the one you have described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall with certainty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a third?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There may have been a third. I certainly recall this radio that
was unusual. The others I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is possible you might be confused between the radio case and
a suitcase.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no; no possibility of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. He checked all these articles, checked them into the
bus station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you and Lee and Marina return to their home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you remain there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. He then helped pack up the remaining things, the playpen,
the bed, and then we left there midafternoon, perhaps 4, all of this must have
taken quite a long time, <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They removed everything from their home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They removed everything that remained to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Put it in the station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Put it in the station wagon and went with Lee and Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your station wagon was big enough to hold everything in the
house, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, they had no furniture, but it held all the rest of their
things; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he do the packing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were you doing in the meantime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Packing was haphazard, this packing was haphazard; put the
dishes in a box and carried it out to the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was in the open so you could see what went into your car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so. I certainly then repacked it to go to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I want to stick with this occasion, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a rifle packed in the back of the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't see any kind of weapon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Firearm, rifle, pistol, or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I saw nothing of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you drive them to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were the materials and things in your station wagon unpacked
and placed in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see that being done, were you present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I helped do it; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see any weapon on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether a rifle, pistol <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or any covering, any package, that looked as though it might
have a weapon, pistol, or firearm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to this moment, Mrs. Paine, had there been any discussion
with Marina or with Lee Harvey Oswald in connection with his life in Russia
with the use of a firearm or his right to use one in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never heard him mention anything of this sort. Michael told
me later he mentioned it to Michael.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. State that, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Michael told me later that Lee had complained in Michael's hearing
that they did not permit a private individual to have a gun, but I didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
hear that when it was said. So there was no discussion at any time that
mentioned guns, nothing brought up by Marina or Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will broaden my question. Up to&mdash;now up to, and not including,
up to November 22, 1963, had there ever been any discussion between you and
Lee Harvey Oswald or between you and Marina or any discussion in the presence
of either of them by anybody, including yourself, about the use of a firearm by
Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Marina told me that he had been hunting in the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, please, to the best of your recollection when did that
occur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When did she tell me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It might have been as long ago as May, when she was first staying
at my house. She quoted a proverb to the effect that you go hunting in the
Soviet Union and you catch a bottle of vodka, so I judge it was a social occasion
more than shooting being the prime object.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in this period when she was living with you in the spring
of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It could have been there. It might have been in October, but I
would guess it was in May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish you would elaborate on that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wish I wouldn't guess, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say that Lee Harvey Oswald had some kind of a firearm
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he had gone hunting with a group, in other words, in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the <span class="locked">occasion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And she quoted this proverb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you remember the circumstance in which she made that
utterance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything that provoked it or brought it about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think she was probably recalling something of their life in
Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In a discussion between you and Marina as to their life in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any other occasion in which a discussion occurred between you
and either of them or in their presence while you were present on the subject
of a firearm prior to November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On one occasion around the middle of November I said to Marina
<span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Lee Harvey Oswald present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was not present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just Marina and you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just Marina and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I said to her that I did not want to buy toy guns for my
children, and that this view of things was shared with a German friend of mine
who had been a young girl at the time of the last World War in Germany,
and she didn't wish to buy guns for her children to play with, and I said too few
people think about this. She said nothing in reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She didn't say anything at all in response to that. Does that
exhaust your recollection of all discussion of firearms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That occurred in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Up to, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. There was no suggestion of Lee's using a firearm for hunting
purposes in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None; nor that he might have had any gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Nor that he might have had any gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After Marina's things and the baby's things had been placed in
your home then what occurred in the evening, was this late in the day of the
24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was close to supper. I am sure we then ate and put our children
to bed, possibly talked a short time. I no doubt explained to her quite
soon that I was to go away for the weekend. Indeed, this invitation was made
quite on the spur of the moment. You don't normally invite someone to come
and stay with you when you are about to go away, but I was to go to a folk-dance
camp with Michael that weekend, and you see on the calendar "FDC"
which stands for folk-dance camp, arrow San Antonio. That is the 26th,
27th and 28th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I noticed that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I left her in the house with the telephone number of my
Russian tutor to call, and I believe they talked, in fact, before I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us the name of your Russian tutor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question that we passed by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When you unloaded Marina's things and the baby's things, did
this subtract one suitcase from this number you have indicated? Was one of
the suitcases delegated to her things or were they just loose in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Insofar as I remember, I believe they were loose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They were loose. So that the number of suitcases you have
indicated were those that were eventually checked and taken by Lee Harvey
Oswald to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that is the way I remember it. It does not seem reasonable
that he would go off without leaving her a suitcase to put her things in, so I
would guess there was something for her in the nature, perhaps, of a small bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So that one of these bags may have been unloaded at your
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You testified, I believe, you started to testify, that there was also
a radio that had been presumably purchased in Russia. Did he take that
with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He took that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. He took that with him. He didn't return that to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, I don't want to speculate, but I thought you had
testified in response to my questions that the two or three pieces of luggage, that
is, the suitcases, plus the two duffel bags, plus the zipper bag, plus the radio, had
been checked into the bus station.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All of those pieces of luggage were actually checked in, and when
you left the bus station none of the pieces of luggage or the radio or the duffel
bags had been placed back in your car.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall it, but it seems to me <span class="locked">unreasonable&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, please, I don't want you to rationalize. I want your best
recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I cannot recall. I mean the suitcases that came to my <span class="locked">house&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall having taken one of the pieces of luggage and
placed that piece back in your station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no, no, that is definite. All that went to the bus station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Remained there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Remained there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At what stage did they go to the bus station? Did you go from
their apartment to your house and then to the bus station or did you go to the
bus station first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Directly to the bus station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And then went to your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Directly to the bus station from their apartment, back to their
apartment and picked up the rest of the things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The baby things and her clothing and then went to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, apart from your rationalization, do you have the
recollection that there was any luggage at all in the Oswald home when you
got back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I have no such recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that in response to Mr. Dulles' questions when you talked
about the possibility of some luggage, you were rationalizing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are not drawing on your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it your best recollection, in fact, is that there was no
luggage remaining at the Oswald home when you got back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was nothing packed when we got back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall undertaking to pack anything when you got back
in order to remove what they had there remaining to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You mean was there a suitcase into which I could pack anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, you have related to us that you went away for
the weekend.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With your husband.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have an entry in your diary, and I quote it on the 24th
of April, 1963: "Lee and Marina."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that an entry made after the fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I judge that <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, please give me your best recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the plan to meet, knowing Lee was no longer working;
it was there for not only a meeting with Marina, but I expected to see them both
at the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that is confined to the meeting you expected to have with Lee
and Marina that morning when you went there and, to your surprise, you found
that Mr. Oswald was all packed to go to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All packed and looking for a cab; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did Marina remain in your home on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She stayed then until May 9&mdash;well, excuse me, she stayed until
the 10th of May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have an entry, do you not, in your diary as to the May 9th
or 10th.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Read it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It says now going over to the 11th "New Orleans."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have written across then "May 10 and May 11," is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What does the "New Orleans" signify, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lee called on the evening of the 9th to say he had work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall that definitely. Marina says, "Papa naslubet," "Father
loves us," "Daddy loves us, he got work and he wanted us to come." She was
very elated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Marina talking to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I could see as she talked on the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You overheard this conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Afterward. She said over and over, "Papa naslubet," "Daddy
loves us," "Daddy loves us."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was elated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was elated and, let's see, we tried to think when we could
leave, and first said over the phone that we would leave on the morning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
11th. But I thought it would be too long to do all this in one day, and we accelerated
our preparations and left midday on the 10th which got us to Shreveport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before we get into this, and I would like to cover this interim
period before any adjournment today; there was a 16-day period now, approximately,
maybe we will limit it to 15 days, that Marina stayed with you in your
home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have conversations with her about her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About their life in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, even going so far as to <span class="locked">wonder&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During this 15-day period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. We had such conversations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate to us your discussions with Marina with
respect to her husband Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she wondered if he did, in fact, love her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said she supposed most couples had at some time wondered
about this. She wondered herself whether she loved him truly. She talked
some of her few months of dating that she had in Minsk, and of living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is before her marriage to Lee Harvey?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. At some point, and I want to tell you this, whether it is
appropriate or whether it happened later in October, I can't be certain, but I think
in May she told me that she had written a letter to a previous boyfriend, and
that this letter had come back because she had put insufficient postage on it,
and Lee had found it at the door coming back through the mail, and had been
very angry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she go beyond that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did not. To tell me what was in the letter, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not thinking so much within the letter. Did she go beyond
stating that he was merely only angry? Was there any discussion about his
having struck her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; none. No; none. She never mentioned to me ever that Lee
had struck her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And during all the visits you ever had with her, all the tete-a-tetes,
her living with you on this occasion we now describe as 15½ days, and in the
fall, was there any occasion when Marina Oswald related to you any abuse,
physical abuse, by her husband, Lee Harvey Oswald, with respect to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was never any such occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Never any such occasion. And in particular this incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She related this incident, but it did not include anything further
than he had been very angry and hurt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to this time, that is, the time she came to you on the 24th,
had you ever seen any <span class="locked">bruises&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I never saw <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On her person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I never saw her bruised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At no time that you have ever seen her or known her, have you
ever seen her bruised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At no time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that there has been no occasion when you have seen it, or
been led to believe, she had been subjected to any physical abuse by her
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion during these 15 days of any occasion
when Marina had gone off to live with someone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I think she told me that in the fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. As long as I have raised that, would you please give us
the time and the occasions and tell us what occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What she told me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What she said. When was this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This probably was in October. She told me that the previous
year she <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. She had in the fall, she had gone to a friend's home, left
Lee. She described his face as she left, as shocked and dismayed and
unbelieving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unbelieving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In a sense that she was truly walking out on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Excuse me. Did she put it in those terms, that she was leaving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was leaving; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She left him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and went to stay with a friend. Then moved to the
<span class="locked">home&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she name the friend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did not name the friend; no. The friend's name came up in
another connection, but I had no way of making the connection until after I
learned about this to whom she referred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you now recall the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She went to Katya Ford's.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. To the Fords?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To Katya, being the friend, Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then moved. She did tell me this. She had moved on the
weekend to a different home. Then Lee came there, pleaded for her to come
back, promised that everything would be different. She went back and she reported&mdash;as
she reported it to me, things were no different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were not different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Were not different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you undertake a discussion with her as to what the things
were that were disturbing her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That offended her that much? No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That led her to leave her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was no discussion of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you ever witness any altercations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed I saw them argue a good deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Sharp arguments?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But no violence of any kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No physical violence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Any profanity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not sure I know Russian profanity. He was very curt and
told her to shut up quite a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the presence of others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Particularly in New Orleans the first time when we went down,
when I took her to New Orleans in May, he was very discourteous to her, and
they argued most of that weekend. I was very uncomfortable in that situation,
and he would tell her to shut up, tell her, "I said it, and that is all the discussion
on the subject."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What were the kinds of discussions that prompted
this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall that, and I have already had my brain picked trying
to, with other people trying to, to recall what was the difficulty. I do recall
feeling that the immediate things they were talking about were insufficient
reason for that much feeling being passed back and forth, and I wondered if
I wasn't adding to the strain in the situation, and did my best to get back to
Texas directly. But the&mdash;well, I do recall one thing, yes&mdash;we arrived with a
big load of blackberries that we bought from a vendor along the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On the way down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the way down, on the road, and ate them, and then, he, one
morning, started to make blackberry wine, and she bawled him out for it, what
a waste of good blackberries, and she said, "What do you think you are doing?
Ruining all this." And he proceeded, and argued about it, but thought he
should, you know, defend himself. On this occasion she was making the attack
in a sense and didn't think he should do it this way, and then, so, under fire and
attack, he continued. But then the next day she observed that he had tossed it
all out and lost heart after the argument, and decided it <span class="locked">wasn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He tossed out the wine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He tossed it out; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You detected, then, irritability as between them. Is that a
fair statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And anger rose to the surface pretty easily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very easily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression? Of course he hadn't seen her then
for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about it&mdash;when she came in. Did they embrace?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. We arrived at his uncle's in one section of New Orleans,
and had a very friendly half hour or <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he was there. He introduced her and little June, and played
with June, on his shoulders, perhaps. At any rate, he was very glad to see the
baby, and was congenial and outgoing. We talked with the relatives for a
short time.</p>

<p>Then the uncle drove them to the apartment&mdash;I was following with my children
in my car&mdash;drove to the apartment he had rented, which was in a different section
of the city. And Lee showed her, of course, all the virtues of the apartment
that he had rented. He was pleased that there was room enough, it was
large enough that he could invite me to stay, and the children, to spend the night
there. And he pointed out this little courtyard with grass, and fresh strawberries
ready to pick, where June could play. And a screened porch entryway.
And quite a large living room. And he was pleased with the furniture and
how the landlady had said this was early New Orleans style. And Marina was
definitely not as pleased as he had hoped. I think he felt&mdash;he wanted to please
her. This showed in him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what she said. What led you to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said it is dark, and it is not very clean. She thought the
courtyard was nice, a grass spot where June could play, fenced in. But there was
very little ventilation. We immediately were aware there were a lot of
cockroaches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she aware of this, and did she comment on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know as anything was said. He was pretty busy explaining.
He was doing his best to get rid of them. But they didn't subside. I remember
noticing that he was tender and vulnerable at that point, when she
arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was tender?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Hoping for&mdash;particularly vulnerable, hoping for approval from
her, which she didn't give. It wasn't a terribly nice apartment. And she had
been disappointed, because when we first arrived she thought that the home
we were going to was the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She thought the Murrets' home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. So when we came up to the Murrets' home, she said, "This
is lovely, how pleased I am." So that she was in&mdash;disappointed by contrast with
the apartment that she really had to live in.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She expressed this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She expressed her disappointment; yes; and didn't meet his
hopes to be pleased with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As compared with their previous place of residence, how was the
New Orleans apartment? It was bigger, I gather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was larger. It was darker, less well ventilated. It was on the
first floor, the other was upstairs. I would say they were comparable in cost
and in attractiveness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about vermin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't see any vermin at the first place. But then I didn't spend
the night there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So the welcoming was cordial?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The welcoming was cordial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They seemed to have a fine relationship at that moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But as the weekend progressed, and she saw the new apartment,
all the time you were there, you were aware of friction and irritability?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Going back to the 15 days again, was there any discussion during
this period, again, on the subject of Mr.&mdash;of Lee Oswald wishing Marina to
return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe I made definite, but only verbal, an invitation for her to
stay on with me, past the time of the baby's birth, if she wished to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it&mdash;I will get into that. But I take it your answer to my
question first is yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, tell us what that discussion was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how it arose.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, we still discussed the possibility of her coming back to have
the baby here&mdash;although by no means a definite&mdash;definitely planned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. I am a little confused. When you say coming back
to have the baby <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was assumed she would go to New Orleans when he called,
but we talked about the possibility of her coming back to Dallas. I said she
was still welcome to if she wants to, if it seems appropriate, to come here to have
the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was to your house, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; to stay at my house before, or especially right after the
baby's birth, where I could look after June while she was in the hospital and
later. June didn't take readily to strangers. She did like me and was comfortable
with me, so I felt she might want to have someone she knew and got
along with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But in this connection, was there a discussion between you and
Marina Oswald subject to her husband wishing her to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe she again said that he was after her to return.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, then, on the whole, your answer to my question would be
no.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. As far as I recall, it came up only once in our
discussions prior to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you have already related?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion during the 15-day period on the subject
of her acquiring greater facility with the English language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his attitude toward that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His attitude had already been discussed, and I don't believe it was
particularly discussed further. But she did indicate that she was going to try
to learn some anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Despite that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I judged so. I asked if she had a book written in Russian
entitled "The Self Teacher in the English Language." She did not. And I
ordered it. And I think I gave it to her even then. I am quite certain of that.
This turned out to be not much help. At least she was interested in trying
to learn English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion of the subject of it being disclosed
to the Russian emigré group that she was pregnant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she continued to ask me not to mention that. We did,
however, meet someone in the Russian emigré group in Fort Worth after
she had the first day put on maternity clothes&mdash;and so she was sorry that that
meeting had occurred. She judged now people would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Did anything else occur in the way of discussions
during that 15-day period on the subject of life in Russia, his political philosophy,
how they got along, his general disposition, her reaction to America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She discussed her reaction to America. She was very impressed
with the variety of goods available in the stores. She thought the quality was
better here than in Russia. Then there was more of that later in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will get to that, in October. Have we pretty well exhausted
this 15-day interim period, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Jenner, may I ask a question there? During this
15-day period, did any individual, male or female, come and visit you at your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You mean particularly to see her? I am sure there are people
coming and going at my house. There must have been. For instance, May 1,
Mary&mdash;this is again Miss Mary referred to previously, a babysitter, "8:15.
War and Peace." Mary came and stayed with my children, and Marina and
June and I went to see War and Peace. Miss Mary recalls that meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a play or the movie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is the movie, War and Peace, in English. But, of course,
she knew the story, so she could enjoy seeing it. "Ed tennis confirm." I went
over to play tennis. On the fourth of May, Craig's children&mdash;they came here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Into your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is Craig?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Craig is this young German woman who didn't want to buy guns
for her children either, that I mentioned. And we exchanged children often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does she speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; German only, and English. And, mow the lawn, it says on
the third, but that is not me, it is a neighbor who mows the lawn. And May 9
in the morning, "Ilse"&mdash;means Mrs. Craig again&mdash;kept my children while I went
at 8:10 to Saint Marks for an interview. So there was a normal flow. And
I told my immediate neighbor, Mrs. Roberts, who figures later, that Marina was
there over the weekend, that I wouldn't be there, and introduced them, so Marina
could go to Mrs. Roberts and make signs or symbols if she had to get a message
through to someone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Roberts is your next door neighbor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then your response to Representative Ford's question is <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A normal flow to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there wasn't anybody that came specifically to see her from
the Russian emigré group, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Were there any telephone calls to her from anybody
of this group, or any other group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I made the contact for her with my tutor, got her to call.
But that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She probably could not operate the telephone.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She could. That was the first I knew. I wasn't certain. But she
knew how to operate the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am pleased you raised that, sir.
She could dial. Did you have the dial system in effect at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Way out in Irving; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she could dial the number if she wished?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she knew how to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you at any time get any evidence to indicate that she was
in touch with any Soviet officials at all, the consul general? Did she ever talk
of going to the Soviet Embassy or the Soviet Consulate in regard to her problems?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. The only thing ever mentioned was this that I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
mentioned for the record&mdash;that she had written to the Soviet Embassy inquiring
about papers to go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you think she did that on her own initiative?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; because he was insisting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We have a copy of that letter, have we not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did she ever tell you why she didn't want to return to the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said she liked America better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And she rather liked the conditions here better than she had
experienced them in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And that you think was her fundamental motivation for staying
here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Wanting to stay here? When you were in contact with her at
all did any&mdash;when she was staying with you, was there any unidentified characters
or people that called to see her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; there was no one at all that called to see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there any telephone calls received during that period when
you answered the phone that someone asked for Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Only that from Lee on the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Only from Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Only from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No other calls to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And no other callers&mdash;that is persons who came to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What was the name of these&mdash;De Mohrenschildts. Did they
communicate with her when she was with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; my impression is they were already out of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any mail received or delivered to your home during
this period for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think so. It is possible that Lee wrote once. I think
it is more likely she wrote him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the household goods and paraphernalia transferred to your
house, were there any books, pamphlets, literature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't see any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not see any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you ever engage in any discussion or dialectics with Lee
about the respective merits of the capitalist system or the Soviet system? Did
you engage in any debates with him on political philosophy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I once listened to such a debate between Lee and my husband, in
October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You kept out of the debate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I tried hard. I felt it was not going anywhere, and that he was
not a man that could be approached by logic, and that there was no point to
arguing with him. I disagreed with him quite strongly, and I didn't see how it
would help in any way to say so, or to try to change&mdash;certainly it would not
have helped to try to change his views. He, for instance, was of the opinion
that all churches were an arm of the state, intent upon blinding the people. I
thought his thinking was extremely erroneous, and not open to introduction of
other facts, anything contradictory to his own view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did he become intemperate in argument?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But in the course of his discussions with your husband, did he
assert adherence to the element of violence as a <span class="locked">factor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Michael tells me he did. I didn't hear that particular discussion.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In response to Mr. McCloy, you told of this argument
that your husband and Lee Oswald had. You said it was October. This is
October 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you have any more questions? We are going to resume in
the morning at 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Will you be here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes; I will be here.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Then you continue to preside throughout her testimony. I
will be here, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you want to close?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would just as soon adjourn now, if it suits your convenience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. All right. We will excuse you. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 9:05 a.m. on March 19, 1964, at 200
Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman
Cooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, John J.
McCloy, and Allen W. Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel; and Wesley J.
Liebeler, assistant counsel.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mrs. Paine, I must remind you that you are still under affirmation.
We don't take a new affirmation with each hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We had concluded, if you recall, the 15-day period in May that
Mrs. Oswald resided at the home of Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Would you please describe for us the items of household furniture, or whatever
the articles were, that were packed in your station wagon when you took
Mrs. Oswald to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We packed in a play pen and crib. I recall a stroller, some
kitchen utensils, and personal clothing for herself and the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any luggage of any character?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There may have been a small suitcase but I don't recall it
specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am just guessing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As I recall you have told us yesterday that when you arrived
in New Orleans, you went by the Murrets' home first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then from the Murrets' home to the apartment at, what
was that address on Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 4907.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was 4907 rather than 4905.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, there has been a touch of testimony, at least of
the possibility that Mr. Oswald may have dry-fired or dry-sighted any rifle
in the courtyard or garden space at 4907?</p>

<p>Would you be good enough to draw for us free hand the layout, at least the
ground layout of the 4907 premises on Magazine Street in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now, shall I describe this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could I first show the diagram. I have marked the diagram
the witness has drawn as Commission Exhibit No. 403.</p>

<p>(The diagram referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 403 for
identification.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, might it be helpful and permissible if I had
the witness stand to your rear and point to the diagram so that you might follow
her testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This street is Magazine Street; it is a corner house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine, left on your plot is east and west and
up and down are north and south?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is the way I recall it. This is a corner house and
there was room <span class="locked">enough&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, I have to keep the record. You are referring now
to a square on the right-hand margin of your outline.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Between this house, and the courtyard and house where the
Oswalds were staying, there was room enough to drive a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you marked the courtyard with that word?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have written "courtyard" in the sort of an "L"
shaped space that you have indicated on the plot, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is a square space cut by a walk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was a low fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say this, it does not help us on the record; what is
this to which you have pointed&mdash;you have written something across it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Around this courtyard and in front of the house was a low
metal picket fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you have so designated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was grass within this small courtyard or walk, <span class="locked">steps&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you have also marked "walk"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Steps going up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you have likewise so marked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To a screened porch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Likewise so marked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then the doorway from the porch goes into the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the living room is marked "Living room." Would you
use those names and those designations as you testify?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please indicate the courtyard or square or
oblong portion you have marked, rectangular portion, that was open space,
was it, it was not roofed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was fully open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was fully open, and it faced out on Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was there open space to the east, that would be toward the
building, which you have merely designated as an empty square?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will write in here "driveway;" this was open here as a driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, is that what you have now marked a building, a
dwelling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a dwelling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there dwellings to the south of Magazine Street and on
the opposite side of the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That so far as I recall, that is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was to the east in the way of dwellings or buildings?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The rest of the house; they lived in a portion; entered from the
side door of a large house; I assume it was once a one-family dwelling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then for our purpose here as far as the courtyard is concerned
on the east it was&mdash;there was a walk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. West, I am sorry. On the west line of the courtyard there was
a walk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the north of the courtyard there was the screened porch and
to the east, but with intervening driveway there was a dwelling house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then the courtyard was open on Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your recollection serve you that anybody standing in the
courtyard and dry-sighting a rifle would be visible to people who just happened
by, or who would be looking out a window on the south side of Magazine Street,
or in the home or in the dwelling house to the east of the courtyard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He would have been very visible. Would have collected a clutch
of small boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a neighborhood, then, in which there were small
children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a reasonably busy street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very busy street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were the days of the week that you were there when you
returned, when you brought Mrs. Oswald to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When we first went down, we arrived on Saturday, I was there
Sunday and Monday and left Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Does your recollection serve so that you can state that the days you were
there you observed during the daytime, at least many or a reasonable number
of small children and mothers and fathers, in and about the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A good many small children and adults.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that likewise true when you returned in September about
which you will testify in a few moments?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was certainly true in September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No.
403, a plot which Mrs. Paine has just drawn and which is so marked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. So received.</p>

<p>(The diagram referred to heretofore, marked Commission Exhibit No. 403
for identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the dwelling in which the Oswalds were residing, 4907
Magazine Street, a single level or a double level house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was all on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a one-story house, one story high?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a segment of a house that probably had two stories to it.
I don't recall. But the segment they had was all on one level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was the ground level?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to Exhibit No. 403, and Mr. Dulles,
would you favor me by handing her the exhibit, and with particular reference
to the screen porch, the screen porch likewise opened up on Magazine Street,
did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it was set back a short space from the street, but the door
opened up toward Magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The screened portion, that is, that faced on Magazine Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If anyone were on the screen porch, let us say, dry-sighting a rifle
or some other firearm, would he be, would that person be observable from
Magazine Street, and from the east?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I doubt he would have been noticed from Magazine Street. A
small boy passing in the driveway could have looked through the screen, up to
<span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is to the east?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will mark "screen" on the south and east side so you know it
is screened on both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall for certainty but there may have been a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
shade that could have been put down. It was not when I was there, down, but
there may have been some means <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lattice shade?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Putting down a lattice blind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A blind or something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course, if the blind were down no one could see it. Did you
have occasion when you were there, Mrs. Paine, on either of your two trips to
be on the screen porch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And looking out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was there any impediment to your view?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I could see the street very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion there on either of those occasions to be
out in the courtyard or on the street to be looking into the porch area.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you see the persons, from the courtyard, could you see persons
behind the screen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From the courtyard you could see persons behind the screen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do I take it then by your emphasis on courtyard, do you mean
by that if you were on Magazine Street itself, that is the sidewalk in front of
the home it would be difficult to see in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Looking directly in you would notice someone but just passing
by you would not have been apt to see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But if you looked directly you could see in on the porch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned yesterday a series of letters and correspondence
and you spent some time with me last night and we went over all that, do you
recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have your summary we worked with last night at hand
to assist you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you mind taking that out, please?</p>

<p>You mentioned yesterday in your testimony a note that you had sent to
Marina Oswald shortly after your initial acquaintance with her in February of
1963. Did you receive a response to that note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did; and I have that response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have here a document which we will mark as Commission Exhibit
No. 404, including its envelope as 404A.</p>

<p>Is that the document or note you received from Mrs. Oswald and the envelope?</p>

<p>(The document and envelope referred to were marked Commission Exhibits
Nos. 404 and 404A, respectively, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did that reach you in the ordinary course of its posting by mail?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with the handwriting of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that&mdash;do you identify the handwriting in that document 404?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is her handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it in the same condition now as it was when you received
it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is her response to your note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence as Exhibit No. 404 the document now so
marked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
(The letter and envelope referred to, heretofore marked for identification as
Commission Exhibits Nos. 404 and 404-A, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that is in what language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is in Russian. Except for the address on the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Have you made a translation of that note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it the translation on the notes that you exhibited to me
last night which we have marked as No. 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I inquire, Mr. Chairman, if you would prefer that I read the
translation in evidence or may we have <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It is a short note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a short note. Others are a little longer, however, and if I
have your permission, to save you time, I would read that into the record during
the noon recess or something of that character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that acceptable.</p>

<p>Now, did you thereafter&mdash;you wrote Mrs. Oswald at or about that time in response
to that note of yours, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. Let's see&mdash;I don't recall whether I did or not or whether
I arrived on the Tuesday that she had suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have a little difficulty in handling these, Mr. Chairman, because
they are in Russian, and I don't immediately have a vision of it.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am handing you a document which I have numbered as No. 2.</p>

<p>Would you locate that for me on your summary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the second page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That note also in Russian but in whose handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is a draft, I take it, of a letter or note that you transmitted
to Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Would you identify in your sheaf of notes the point at which you made a
translation of that note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When did I make a translation of it? I didn't understand your
question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you point out in your notes the translation of the document?
Is that the center of the page on page 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the document which I will have marked as Commission Exhibit
No. 405 in your handwriting?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 405 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it in the same condition now as it was when you completed it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; being, of course, a rough draft of what I sent and not what
I sent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do not have the original of that because you sent it to
Marina Oswald, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it does represent your present best recollection of the note
as you transmitted it to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. This note is without a date. Shall I give my
recollection of when I think it was written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was written in March and referred to&mdash;it closes, "Until
the 20th." I believe that referred to Wednesday, March 20, which is what appears
here with the name Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which is what you testified to yesterday, and when you say
"appears here" you meant Exhibit 401?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence the original document which has now been
identified as Commission Exhibit No. 405.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 405 for
identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will read the translation in the record during the noon recess.
You shortly transmitted another letter of your own to Mrs. Oswald, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I have here a document which I have marked Commission
Exhibit No. 406. Is this a draft of the letter in your handwriting?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 406 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you shortly after the completion of that draft retranscribe
it and transmit the letter to Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you made a translation of that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the draft of that document in the same condition now as it was
when you completed it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is that document transcribed on your notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is at the top of page 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what we call No. 3, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And dated March 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This, Mr. Chairman, is her note to which she testified yesterday
was an invitation to the Oswalds to dinner at her home on April 2.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It appears&mdash;the following invitation is a full explanation of it. I
believe I had made the explanation in person. This letter was to say that
Michael would come and pick them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was confirmation of your original invitation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; this was that Michael could pick them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence a document marked Commission Exhibit No.
406.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 406 for
identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive from Marina herself a note with respect to your
invitation to have her and her husband join you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a note which I take to be a reply to that invitation, saying
that that date, Tuesday, would be fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I hand you Commission Document No. 407.</p>

<p>Is that the note you received from Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 407 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you made&mdash;is it in the same condition now as it was when
you received it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no envelope anymore. I don't know what happened to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the note itself in the same condition as it was at the time
you received it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I have written on it in my hand to help me understand
the meaning of it, some pen notations, translation of the Russian words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am interested in that, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Did you also&mdash;are there some additions in your handwriting on the first
page of the note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, marked one, two, three, four and clearly taken from a
dictionary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To explain to myself the meaning of these particular words.
I had to look them up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it a fair statement, Mrs. Paine, that your command of the
Russian language was not facile enough for you to read the total letter freehand,
as soon as you received it, but you wrote on the letter definitions of words and
of phrases to assist you in interpreting it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a fair statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were all the notations you have now identified placed by you
on that letter shortly after you received it, or in the course of your effort to
interpret it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, save for those additions of yours, is the document in the
same condition now as it was when you received it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it otherwise in the same condition as it was when you
placed those notes on it?</p>

<p>In other words, there have been no notes of your own placed on the document
subsequent to, at, or about the time you received it when you were attempting
to interpret it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, you first said, or when I was translating it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I translated it immediately for myself at the time, and then
when I made a written translation I made a more careful one so that some of
these notes were done a week ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what I was getting at.</p>

<p>Would you please, for the Commission identify the particular notes that
you placed on there at the time you were seeking to interpret it when you
first received it, and the notes you placed on there about a week ago, and indicate
the pages.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can easily answer that.</p>

<p>There is only one that was placed more recently. That is an underline
on the inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Right-hand inside page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it merely an underlining?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Underline and a question mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you interpret that for us, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I couldn't read her handwriting, but later realized the word
to be "if."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you were seeking to interpret it a week ago to translate
it, you placed a question mark over that word because you couldn't quite figure
it out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then later realized what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As being the word "if"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that, Mrs. Paine, is the document in the condition
it was when you received it and when you initially placed notations on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize that handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, that is Marina Oswald's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you made a translation for the Commission of that
letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that appears in your notes at page what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The first page at the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which I have marked No. 4, I believe, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Beginning "For Ruth and Michael Paine."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your interpretation or translation of the letter represent
your impressions of the letter when you read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is true, is it, of the other translations which we
will introduce through you today? Is that true of all your translations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not sure of what you are inquiring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I am inquiring about, others&mdash;as you related to me last
night&mdash;other persons with the command of the Russian language.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no help with the translations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Other persons with their command of the Russian language might read
one of Marina's letters and have at least, as to some words, an interpretation
different from yours. What I am <span class="locked">saying&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In a minor regard, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It may be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But I believe the meaning would have been the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it is important to get your impressions, Mrs. Paine, of
Marina's letters to you, despite what interpretations some other people might
give to the same letter, and what I am seeking to emphasize is whether your
translations are your impressions of those letters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; but they are good translations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't mean to question that. We seek the impact of these
notes upon you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I see. This is exactly what I understood them to mean, of
course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is fine.</p>

<p>Now, you received in May or on or about May, or shortly after May 25, 1963,
another note from Marina Oswald, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was postmarked May 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After you had taken her to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. This was the first letter I received from her
from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have kindly produced the original of that letter for
the Commission, have you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am sorry, I have to have your answer aloud or I can't get it
on the record.</p>

<p>The document you have produced is marked Commission Exhibit 408.</p>

<p>Do you recognize the handwriting of that note and of that envelope?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 408 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is the handwriting of Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Both documents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive&mdash;that is a letter, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it on or about, did you receive it on or about the date it is
postmarked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Shortly after, I would guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I can see some handwriting written horizontally on the back of
the envelope, is that handwriting yours or Marina's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you place that handwriting on the reverse side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I first read the letter and sought to understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>And those notations are in Russian or in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A word is given in Russian followed by a translation in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As in the case of one of the earlier exhibits, did you place those
notations on the reverse side of the envelope at the time you received the
letter in the course of your attempting to interpret the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And those notations were in the course of your doing that.
Except for the notations on the reverse side of the envelope, is the letter and
is the envelope, each in the same condition now as when you received it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I have made a few underlinings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify any additions you placed on the original
document, indicating the page, front or reverse side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have marked <span class="locked">"bind"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that b-i-n-d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Over one word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you written the word "bind"? Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. B-i-n-d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is an interpretation, I take it of a word written in
Russian underneath it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that word then to you in English was "bind", b-i-n-d.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have written the word "thaw" and crossed it out; that was
wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Meaning what, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had the wrong translation for that word. I realized it later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the word rather <span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The meaning was "insists"; the rest of the markings by me are
underlinings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will cover those by asking you this. Were there any underlinings
on the letter placed there by Marina Oswald at the time you received
the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Only one, under this word here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is on the reverse side of the second page of the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is on the last page. The second page; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is the reverse side of the second sheet of paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it looks to help from her as though it is an arrow, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is an underline and then from the underlined word is an
arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits Nos. 407 and 408 the
documents now so marked and identified by the witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to, heretofore marked for identification as Commission
Exhibits Nos. 407 and 408, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you retain that for a moment, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask, is the envelope 408A attached?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; and in the case of the earlier exhibit the <span class="locked">envelope&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is only the second envelope we have had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The envelope accompanying Exhibit 404 was marked 404A, and
the envelope now accompanying 408 is marked 408A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is it so marked now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you wish me to mark it?</p>

<p>(The enevelope was marked Commission Exhibit 408A for identification and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you supplied the Commission, Mrs. Paine, with your translation
of that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your interpretation and the effect or the impression that
you had of that letter when you received it and as you read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, turning to the first page, I would like to direct <span class="locked">attention&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you wish this back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I will look at the translation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She has supplied me with an interpretation. In the first paragraph
it reads and I quote, and you follow me, please. I will read the whole
paragraph:</p>

<p>"Here it is already a week since I received your letter. I can't produce any
excuses as there are no valid reasons. I am ashamed to confess that I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
person of moods and my mood currently is such that I don't feel much like
anything. As soon as you left all love stopped and I am very hurt that Lee's
attitude toward me is such that I feel each minute that I bind him. He insists
that I leave America which I don't want to do at all. I like America very much
and I think that even without Lee I would not be lost here. What do you think?"</p>

<p>Had you had any discussion with Marina when you were in New Orleans on
the subject matters which I have just read to you from the first paragraph
of her letter, Commission Exhibit No. 408?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no such discussion in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impact did this have on you, Mrs. Paine, when you received
this letter and read that first paragraph?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a repetition, or similar to something she had told me late
in March, which I have already put on the record yesterday, saying basically
that he wanted her to go back, wanted to send her back to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to send her back alone, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the impression I carried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there ever any occassion, during all your acquaintance with
the Oswalds, when there was any suggestion or implication that if she returned
to Russia, at his request, that he would accompany her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no such suggestion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it always that she was to go to Russia alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As she described it, it carried from her the feeling that she was
being sent away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about the little child, June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. June with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was to accompany her to Russia. Now, the second paragraph,
if I may:</p>

<p>"This is the basic question which doesn't leave me day or night. And again
Lee has said to me that he doesn't love me. So you see we came to mistaken
conclusions. It is hard for you and me to live without a return of our love
interest gone. How would it all end?"</p>

<p>Had there been discussions between you and Marina Oswald on the subject
of whether or not her husband had love for her, and in that area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What I particularly recall is what I mentioned yesterday, when
he telephoned her and said he had found a job and wanted her to
<span class="locked">come&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was just before going to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just before going to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the spring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right. She said "Papa loves us," as I have testified. She had
wondered to me during the 2 weeks previous whether he did, whether she
loved him. But was clearly elated by his call and gradually came to her own
conclusions. Really, I had no ground upon which to make a conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She was speaking in Russian then to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, were you impressed that this paragraph, however, was
not consistent with her immediate response at the time that telephone call had
been made to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It showed me there was not as much change as she had hoped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion with her on this subject when you
were in New Orleans, and when you took her or when you were taking her from
Irving, Tex., to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever. When you were in New Orleans, Mrs. Paine,
did you tour any night clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you or Marina ever evidence any interest in touring Bourbon
Street, for example?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are talking about the spring visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We went to the French Quarter during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please identify whom you include when you say "we."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lee, Marina, I, and three children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did all of you, including Lee, go to the French Quarter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you tour the Bourbon Street areas, Royal Street, and the
other areas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; we did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you tell us without any length&mdash;you did not.   This was a
tourist visit of the French Quarter, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With the children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said during the course of that tourist visit about
visiting Bourbon Street at night rather than in the daytime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that there was anything said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion about Lee Oswald visiting or frequenting
night clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either in Dallas, or in New Orleans or in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None; at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any one of you tour Bourbon Street at night during that
spring visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any discussion of the subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a subsequent occasion when you did visit Bourbon
Street at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In September, when I visited again in New Orleans. Shall I
tell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; please, because there is a measure of contrast to that I
would like to bring out.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina and I and our three small children went down in the
early evening and walked along the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us how that came about, whether Lee Oswald
accompanied you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not accompany us. He was asked if he wanted to go,
and he said he did not. Marina was interested in my seeing Bourbon Street
at night simply as a tourist attraction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you two girls took your children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she take June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You two girls walked down Bourbon Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And one of us very pregnant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And observed everything from the outside. You didn't go inside
any night clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. In fact, when I realized we weren't permitted, we went on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had small children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion with Mr. Oswald at that time or with
Marina which led you to form a judgment as to whether he was a man who
might, or would, or had frequented night clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I judged he was not such a person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In all your experiences with the Oswalds from February, sometime
in February 1963, even to the present date, had any mention been made of
Lee Oswald frequenting night clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or of Marina at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No mention of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you get the impression when you made this trip that Marina
had previously made the trip herself, that she seemed to know the surroundings?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This occurs in the next paragraph of the letter she wrote in May,
so I knew she had been herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She had been there before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. From the letter I judge with Lee accompanying her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, if you will pardon me. Mr. Reporter, will you read
the question?</p>

<p>(Question read.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you answer just that question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. She did answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I didn't think she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think she said "yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now the letter of May 25th to you does make reference to visits
to the French Quarter, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gentlemen of the Commission, that portion of the letter reads
as follows:</p>

<p>"Now a bit about the impressions I have received this week. Last Saturday
we went to Aunt Lillian's"&mdash;Aunt Lillian, Mrs. Paine, is Lee Oswald's aunt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mrs. Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "And leaving June with her we are at the lake. Lee wanted to
catch crabs but caught nothing. I have a very high opinion of his relatives."</p>

<p>By the way, what was your opinion of his relatives?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met them only once. I thought them to be very nice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "Straightforward and kind people. To me they are very attentive.
I like them. We have been to the French Quarter in the evening. It is
a shame you didn't manage to get there in the evening. For me it was especially
interesting as it was the first time in my life I had seen such. There were many
night clubs there. Through the open doors were visible barrel covered dancing
girls (so as not to say entirely unclothed). Most of them had really very pretty,
rare figures and if one doesn't think about too many things then one can like
them very much. There were a great many tourists there. For the most part
very rich. We have been to the near park again."</p>

<p>That is all of that paragraph dealing with the nightclubs. Now, did you
ever know a man or person by the name of Jack Rubinstein or Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear of any such individual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you frequented a nightclub in Irving or in Dallas prior
to November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not at any time. In either town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and your husband Michael were not in the habit of visiting,
frequenting nightclubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a fact, is it not, Mrs. Paine that neither you nor Mr. Paine
attended nightclubs at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this true prior to your moving to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there anything that occurred during all these months of
your acquaintance with the Oswalds that did or might have led you to any
opinion as to Lee's frequenting of nightclubs or his acquaintance with nightclubs
or his being intimate with nightclub people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. During the entire time, is that your question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Let us end the day for you for this purpose at November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was, I would say, actively disinterested in going down to
Bourbon Street in the last weekend in September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But even prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was the 21st.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had anything occurred by way of a remark at all that made
an impression on you in the area of his being acquainted possibly with any
nightclub people, any entertainers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There had been no hint of any sort that he was acquainted with
nightclub people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Whether in Dallas, New Orleans or Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Of course, I had not talked to him a great deal up
to the New Orleans trip. Then after that time there was also no hint or mention
of any nightclub people. After that time in New Orleans he did refuse table
wine at my home, so I got the impression of him as a person who didn't like
to drink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During all your acquaintance with Lee Harvey Oswald, did you
ever see him take a drink of spirits, intoxicating spirits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is possible he had beer at the initial party on the 22d of February,
that is as far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression did you have of him as a man of temperance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He teased Marina about liking wine as if it displeased him
mildly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine. You are talking in terms of conclusions
which is all right with me if you will give me the specifics also. Could you give
us an example or an occasion of what you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, at the same occasion when he refused the wine, she had
some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Did he say something that led you to say he was teasing
her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe what that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indicating a mild disapproval.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate to the Commission your impression of
Marina Oswald as a temperate person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did not like liquors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What we would call hard liquor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Strong spirits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Strong spirits.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But she did drink beer at my home, and did occasionally have
wine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She occasionally had a bit of wine and she occasionally had
some beer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the extent of, as far as your personal knowledge is concerned,
her indulgence in intoxicating spirits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that likewise describe your indulgence or do <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would also drink a cocktail on occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But very limited and just an occasional drink?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that likewise true of your husband, Michael?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina ever drink to excess?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Certainly not that I ever heard about or saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not that you ever heard about or that you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your testimony that is certainly true with Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is certainly true of him also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you are concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I think you testified yesterday that Marina would assist
you in your becoming more proficient in the Russian language by returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
letters that you had written her, upon which she would place her comments of
instruction or criticism or suggestion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Before she left for New Orleans in May, she offered to correct
and send back any letters I wrote to her. In the correspondence which included
some four letters with her altogether, there was only one of mine that
was actually corrected and sent back and you have that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have marked a three-page document as Commission Exhibit
409, and the envelope as Commission Exhibit 409A, the envelope being postmarked
at New Orleans on June 6, 1963, and being addressed to Mrs. Ruth
Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do you want to make a separate designation for my return
letter? You are looking at the letter which accompanied her letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That document I will mark as Commission Exhibit&mdash;&mdash;may I
have permission, Mr. Chairman, to mark this document in my own hand because
the sticker, I am afraid, will obliterate some of the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will mark this as 409B.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Paine, would you be good enough to identify 409, 409A, and 409B,
the sequence in which they passed back and forth between you and Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It includes, No. 409 is my letter to her dated the 1st of June,
which <span class="locked">she&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that document, or do you recognize the handwriting on that
document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn to the reverse side of the second page, third
page. I see there is something on that in red crayon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All the red marks and the little bit in ballpoint pen are made by
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what I was seeking to bring out.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the end it includes a note of comments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, the portion of the letter in blue ink in longhand
is in whose handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the portion of the letter in red crayon on the reverse side
of the third page is in whose handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is in her handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the first page is there any of her handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the first page in blue ink, ballpoint pen there is some handwriting
which is hers at the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those are notations in between the lines or in the margin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Above my writing. Yes; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are comments of hers on your letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And my spelling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of your spelling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do any of those markings appear other than on the face of the
first sheet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In blue ink you are asking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. The rest is all in red.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That then was a letter that you had sent to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it returned to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did some document which you now have before you accompany
the letter on its return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her letter dated June 5th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which has been marked Commission Exhibit 409B?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do recognize that handwriting as having been hers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the two documents you have now identified, 409 and 409B,
were they enclosed in an envelope?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that envelope before you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is marked Commission Exhibit 409A?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are all those conditions of documents in the condition which
they were in when you received them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have again added in my hand on her letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is 409B?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Translations of certain of the words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please, for the purpose of the record, identify what
your handwriting is, on the letter 409B.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is above her words. Most of it is in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is in your hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that, are the documents in the condition they were
when you received them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is one interesting thing to me, Mrs. Paine, to which I
would like to draw the attention of the Commission. And I direct your attention
in this respect to Exhibits 404, 404A, 408, 408A, 409, and 409A. Each has an
envelope addressed to you, and each is addressed written in English.</p>

<p>Is the handwriting on each of those envelopes Marina Oswald's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was then able to write some English, is that so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you <span class="locked">please&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She learned her own address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did her command of the use of the English language, at least
from the writing standpoint, extend beyond those examples?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my knowledge. I knew that she looked at signs and had
learned the sound value of the English letters. That she looked at the Thursday
supplement to the newspaper for the ads on vegetables and things with pictures
on a can or something that showed the English of what it was, to try to
determine what this word was and pronounce it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So she did acquire some command of English with respect to
reading newspapers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not my impression that she could read a newspaper. She
could pick out the sound values. It was not until October that I read with her
a portion from Time magazine regarding Madam Nhu, whenever that was news,
she asked me to read this to her and translate it. I read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you read it in English first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I read it in English, giving translation of some of the words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As you went along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As I went along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But many of the words, English words, were words she understood,
because they were either similar to the Russian or because she had
learned them.</p>

<p>I was surprised at how much she understood when I pronounced it and read
it to her.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In English. Because she was very hesitant to speak English
with me, fearful that her pronunciation would not be correct. She would ask
me several times, "How do I pronounce this," although she didn't think she
was doing very well with the pronunciation, although she did well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was sensitive in this respect, Mrs. Paine, she was hesitant
to use the English language in the presence, say, of Americans or even the
Russian emigré groups?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think most people are sensitive about using a language when
the person they are with can understand them in the language they use better.
She also talked with my immediate neighbor for a short time, when only she
and the neighbor were present. I went to see about a child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could your neighbor understand Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there was a measure of communication?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was some communication, not a great deal. My neighbor
told me after she saw Marina on television in January, whatever it was, "that
girl has learned a great deal of English." She was amazed at the change.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The improvement from October to January?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How would you appraise her general intelligence, her level of
intelligence for a girl of that age in the early twenties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think she certainly had above average intelligence.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What prompted her, if you know, to ask about Madam
Nhu?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was interested in the family. She was worried about what
Madam Nhu would do. Madam Nhu and the children still in her country. She
wanted to know were these children going to come out either in Paris or the
United States. She was concerned, and her concern for world affairs seemed
to go this way, of what is this mother and children going to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she concerned about the conflict between the North Vietnamese
and the South Vietnamese?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; this didn't interest her, it didn't appear to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was the human side rather than the political side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Strictly that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you; that is what I wanted to bring out. I offer in evidence,
Mr. Chairman, as Exhibits with those numbers, the documents marked
Commission Exhibits 409, 409-A, and 409-B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to previously, marked Commission Exhibits Nos.
409, 409-A, and 409-B, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, turning to this series of correspondence which
has now been admitted in evidence, have you made an interpretation for the
Commission of Exhibit 409-B?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where does that appear on your summary you furnished to me
last evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That begins in the middle of page 6, marked second letter from
New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Your interpretation of the letter dealing with the
night club visit of the Oswalds, you have interpreted that for the Commission,
and that appears on page what of your summary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That appears on page 3 marked first letter from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Were you concerned about Mrs. Oswald, about Marina's
condition and her receiving proper medical attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was very concerned about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you write her at any time about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would like to refer you to my letter of June 1st which was
returned in the document you just admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did write her about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote particularly in that letter to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wrote both Lee and Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In this letter I addressed each, and a particular portion of that
letter is in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is Commission Exhibit No. 409?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was to Lee, that particular portion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You incorporated, did you not, in that letter, a direct communication
to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I say in Russian a few words to Lee now about hospital and
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But incorporated in your note in that letter to Lee Oswald you
used the English rather than the Russian language, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wanted to speak of things I couldn't say in Russian. I didn't
have the vocabulary to do it with any ease in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And further I particularly wanted to tell him I thought it important
she get to a doctor and have prenatal care and felt he would be the one who
actually got her there. It was his concern that would produce a visit to the
doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. That explains that portion of the letter which is Commission
Exhibit No. 409.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 409.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I won't go into the details, Mr. Chairman, because these are
recommendations of Mrs. Paine for medical care of Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do I understand you are going to read all of these into the record
at the noon hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the noon hour I will read all of these into the record rather
than do it now. Now you, last night, Mrs Paine, suggested to me you would like
to make an explanation of this series of letters, and I direct your attention to
page 7 of your notes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, the commentary on page 7 by me <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Refreshing your recollection from having read it, you would like
to make a statement to the Commission and you may proceed to do so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It doesn't refresh me enough. I could say this. That when I
received 409-B, her letter, I read it through. I glanced at 409, her corrected&mdash;my
letter which she had corrected, and at the note at the back which began, "You
write well" and assumed this to be commentary on my letter; it was not until I
sat down nearly a month later to write a proper reply to her, I read this through
more carefully and found in the middle of the paragraph discussing my writing
a comment by her saying, "Very likely I will have to go back to Russia after all."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of the record there appears the red crayon to
which I earlier drew your attention on the back of page 3.</p>

<p>Would you read that entire notation of hers so that the Commission may now
know that to which you are now directing your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the back of my letter she writes in red pencil, "You write well,
when will I write that way in English. I think never. Very likely I will have
to go back to Russia after all. A pity."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was the last?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "A pity."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it when you first read that notation on the back of the
third page of the letter you had not noticed the sentence, "Very likely I will have
to go to Russia after all. A pity."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you proceed with your comment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was early July when I read this letter more carefully and I
was shocked that I hadn't noticed this. That my poor Russian made a scanning
of the letter not adequate to picking that up, and I wrote her immediately apologizing
for my bad understanding, and I don't have that letter, but I have three
which followed it, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Do you have a draft, have you produced for the
Commission your immediate preceding draft of that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no rough draft of my first letter explaining my shock and
my worry at this statement of hers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But I have rough drafts of three letters I wrote subsequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever seen at any time a copy or the original of the
letter that you wrote, a draft of which you do not have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate to the Commission your present recollection
of the substance and content of that letter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Much what I have said. That I apologized that my poor Russian
didn't see this immediately and I inquired after her what she was doing, and
asked to hear from her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say, that sentence when you finally did read it rather
shocked you. Would you rather&mdash;would you elaborate on that statement to the
Commission? Why did that shock you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed more final than anything else that had preceded. She
had told me in March that he had asked her to go back, that she had written
to the embassy but she didn't reply to the embassy when the embassy inquired
why. It looked as though she was able to just say no by not doing anything
about it. But this, on the other hand, looked as if she was resigned to the
necessity to go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware at this time, Mrs. Paine, that Lee had applied
to the State Department for a passport and had obtained one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I was not aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first become aware of that, if you ever did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was considerably after the assassination, and I read it in a
paper. I still don't remember what time or day it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did you write Marina on or about the 11th of July?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a rough draft of that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I hand you a document of two pages which has been identified
as Commission Exhibit No. 410.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 410 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Would you please tell us what that document is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is the rough draft, to which I just referred, written to
Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you thereupon prepared the final draft and sent it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This represents, does it not, your best recollection of the contents
of the letter, the letter in its final form as you transmitted it to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think this is probably a very accurate representation of the
letter in its final form. It was the first time I put on paper an invitation to
her to come and stay with me for anything more than a few weeks around the
birth of the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you supplied the Commission with a translation of your
letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that appears at the bottom of page 7 of your notes which
you have supplied to me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I direct your attention, if I may, and the attention of the Commission
as interpreted by Mrs. Paine, the first sentence reads, "Dear Marina, if
Lee doesn't wish to live with you any more and prefers that you go to the
Soviet Union, think about the possibility of living with me."</p>

<p>You just said&mdash;is that the portion of your letter which you say this is the
first invitation you made to Marina to come to live with you generally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was the first written invitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had made an informal invitation face to face when she was
staying the first week in May, but felt as I made it that she didn't take this
seriously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you go on in your letter and you make reference, for example,
to&mdash;let's take the second paragraph of your letter appearing at the top
of page 8 of your notes, "You know I have long received from my parents, I
live dependent a long time. I would be happy to be an aunt to you and I can.
We have sufficient money. Michael will be glad. This I know. He just gave
me $500 for the vacation or something necessary. With this money it is possible
to pay the doctor and hospital in October when the baby is born, believe
God. All will be well for you and the children. I confess that I think that the
opportunity for me to know you came from God. Perhaps it is not so but I
think and believe so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
Had you discussed this matter with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were still living separate and apart at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But I felt so long as I was not yet earning, he would be
the one, in fact, who was supporting all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think the Commission might be interested in that. You were
not taking this action, either in the earlier stage in the early spring or in the
summer of inviting Marina to live with you without discussing that with your
husband even though you and your husband at that time were separated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do anything, Mrs. Paine, in this connection with respect
to keeping Lee Oswald informed of your invitations and your communications
in this area with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote into the letter that I hoped&mdash;well you might just read
the last paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you mind reading it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will read it, the last paragraph in the letter, and I might say
that the entire letter I wrote with the possibility in mind that he should see this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you desire that he do see it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wanted him to&mdash;her to feel free to show it to him. I didn't
want her to come to my house if this offended or injured him, if this was in
some <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Divisive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If he did in fact want to keep his family together, I certainly
wanted him to, but if the bulk of his feelings lay on the side of wanting to be
away, separated from Marina, then I thought it was legitimate for him to
have that alternative, although it was not legitimate for him to simply send
her back if she didn't want to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Send her back where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the Soviet Union, if she didn't want to go. So in this light I
will read the last paragraph of Commission Exhibit 410:</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurt Lee with this invitation to you. Only I think that
it would be better that you and he do not live together if you do not receive
happiness. I understand how Michael feels. He doesn't love me and wants a
chance to look for another life and another wife. He must do this, it seems,
and so it is better for us not to live together. I don't know how Lee feels. I
would like to know. Surely things are hard for him now, too. I hope that
he would be glad to see you with me where he can know that you and the children
will receive everything that is necessary and he would not need to worry about
it. Thus he could start life again."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, having all this in mind and what you have testified
to up to now, would you please tell the gentlemen of the Commission the factors
and motivations you had in inviting Marina to come live with you; first to have
her baby, next on a more extended scale, all of the factors that motivated you
in your offer, in your own words?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The first invitation, just to come for a few weeks at the time
of the birth is a simpler question, I will answer that first.</p>

<p>I felt that she would need someone simply to take care of her older child for
the time that she was in the hospital, and that things would be easier for her
if she didn't have to immediately take up the full household chores upon returning
from the hospital. This was a very simple offer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was all that motivated you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now, in asking her to come and stay for a more extended period,
I had many feelings. I was living alone with my children, at that time, had
been since the previous fall, nearly a year, at the time this letter is written.
I had no idea that my husband might move back to the house. I was tired of
living alone and lonely, and here was a woman who was alone and in a sense
also, if Lee, in fact didn't want to be with her, and further she was a person I
liked. I had lived with her 2 weeks in late April and early May. I enjoyed
her company.</p>

<p>Further, being able to talk Russian with her added a wider dimension to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
my rather small and boring life as a young mother. I didn't want to go out
and get a job because I wanted to be home with my children, but on the other
hand, I saw a way to, and that is part of what studying Russian altogether is
for me, a way to make my daily life more interesting. I also felt when I first
heard in March that Lee was wanting to send Marina back, that is how it was
presented to me, that it just seemed a shame that our country couldn't be a
more hospitable thing for her if she wanted so much to stay, that I thought
she should have that opportunity.</p>

<p>I was pleased that she liked America, and thought that she should have a
chance to stay here and raise her children here as she wished.</p>

<p>I might say also if I had not been living alone I would not have undertaken
such an invitation. My house is small and it wouldn't have gone with married
life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wanted to afford you that opportunity. Now, you have related
all the factors that motivated you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 410 the document
which has been so identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.
410 for identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. We have been going for an hour and a half. If you would like
to have a recess you may have it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. All right, we will go on then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned in the course of your explanation earlier a series
of three letters. I hand you a draft of letter dated July 12, 1963, addressed
to Dear Marina, consisting of two pages, which we will mark as Commission
Exhibit No. 411. And another one-page letter which we will mark as Commission
Exhibit No. 412.</p>

<p>In whose handwriting is each of those exhibits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Each of these are in my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they are drafts, are they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you would then, after making those drafts put them in
final form?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you transmit the final draft of letter to Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I mailed them to her address in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you supplied me with your translation of both of those
drafts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Each draft is in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the interpretations appearing at the bottom of page 8 and
the bottom of page 9 are the material you supplied me and they consist of your
interpretations of those letters or translations, rather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. They are dated respectively July 12 and July 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I hand you a picture copy rather than a photostatic copy of a
two-page letter dated July 14, 1963, and a translation of that letter which we will
mark as Commission Exhibits Nos. 413 and 414, respectively.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 413 and
414 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to Exhibit 413, would you tell us what
that is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This appears to be a photograph of the letter I then wrote from
my final draft and sent to Marina, dated the 14th of July.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that Exhibit No. 413 is <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 413, the photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 413 is to the best of your recollection an actual picture of your
final draft letter as transmitted to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now directing your attention to page 10 of the material that you
supplied me, and which you discussed with me last evening, you wished to make
a statement to the Commission with respect to this letter, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Would you please proceed to do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it would be easier if I read what is here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any way you want to handle it, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina stayed with me 2 weeks in the spring as you know, and I
realized then what a proud and capable person she is. She was not accustomed
to accept help from others, and I knew that her pride and independence would
be a stumbling block to her accepting help even though she needed it.</p>

<p>I respected her for this and somehow I wanted to ease such acceptance for
her, and to explain that the situation I proposed would be a situation of mutual
help. I hoped&mdash;now I should say that in Commission <span class="locked">Exhibit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are to your right on the table.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; 411 and 412, I mentioned that if she were counted as a dependent
on Michael's income tax his yearly payment to the government would be
reduced by a certain amount, and that by that amount she&mdash;we could very
nearly live&mdash;her expenses could very nearly come under this, so it would be
more a case of breaking even than a case of her accepting so much as she might
think from us. But I think that in fact this reference to the tax reduction did
not encourage her, as I had hoped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It wasn't quite correct either, was it, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>(Laughter.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did I get a chance to read the second letter as written at 2 a.m.
and I was hopeful only more <span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, I think the members of the Commission and also you
from our talk last night, are interested in your letters which you have now
identified suggesting financial arrangements to Mrs. Oswald, since to one who
might read them without knowing the background they might seem crass.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt crass in Russian, particularly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was not thinking in terms of your difficulty in communicating
with her, but you had no selfish or ulterior financial motive, did you, in this
connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did it appear that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It might.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Even with such bad arithmetic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your arithmetic was all right. Your interpretation of the law
was not as good as it might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Am I not correct, I understood you were trying to make her feel
she was not going to be a burden to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And were using certain subterfuges to accomplish that; that is
the impression I got from what you said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is absolutely correct. That I hoped, and further I would
say in the letters to her I made reference that this money not paid to the government
would be therefore available for spending money for her. I had put
myself in her position and thought wouldn't it be terrible to have to ask for a
nickel for a package of Lifesavers every time you wanted it, and thought I
wouldn't want to be in such a situation if she doesn't have her own, something
she can count upon as her own money, it would be unbearable to her.</p>

<p>So I tried to cast about both for a way of making her feel that this would not
be a burden to us, and a way of getting her petty cash in the pocket that she
would not feel was a handout. So that it would be a legitimate possibility
for her to consider.</p>

<p>I judge that my effort in this regard, besides the bad understanding of the tax
law and the poor arithmetic, didn't help because of her following letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what I was coming to. Before we get to that, Mrs. Paine,
I direct your attention to Commission Exhibit No. 414.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 414?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a translation of your letter, Commission Exhibit No. 413.
Have you read that translation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything in the translation to which you might desire
to take exception or at least make a comment?</p>

<p>(At this point Chief Justice Warren left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One minute. Yes, it accurately reflects some of my bad Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You take no exception to the translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, if you please, I offer in evidence, Mr. Dulles, may
I have those <span class="locked">exhibits&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As Commission Exhibits 411, 412, 413 and 414, the documents that
had been so marked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred, previously marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 411,
412, 413, and 414, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did receive a response from Marina, did you not, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the response the document now handed to you marked
Commission Exhibit No. 415?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you supplied the Commission with your translation of that
letter and that <span class="locked">translation&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 415 is that what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 415. It appears on pages 10, 11, and 12 of the material you
supplied me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't have an envelope but you have a letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't have an envelope. I don't know what happened to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the exhibit in Marina Oswald's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything on the exhibit other than that in the handwriting
of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There are a few underlinings on the page marked four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who placed them there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which are my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except for the underlining "he does not know" at the very bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "He" refers to whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were about to state to the Commission Marina Oswald's reaction
to your series of invitations. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you proceed then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As reflected in this letter. This was the third letter I received
from her after a space of over a month, and I had been very concerned about
her. I was much relieved to get it. She said she had been to the doctor and her
condition was normal. She responded to this series of four letters of which we
have three in rough draft, saying&mdash;shall I read in some of the things said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the extent that you desire to do so. We will not read the whole
letter, it is quite long; that which is pertinent to what you have in mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that for a considerable period Lee has been good to her,
she writes. He talks a lot about the coming baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps you might pick out&mdash;there are only about four sentences.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "He has become more attentive and we hardly quarrel".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This indicates a change somewhat in relationship and would
you please read that portion of the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we have the date of this letter once again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The date of the letter. We have no date on the letter. It was
written somewhere between July 18 and July 21, which is the date of my reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is how you identify it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right. Again, "He has become much more attentive and we
hardly quarrel. True I have to give in a great deal. It could not be otherwise.
But if one wants peace then it is necessary to give in. We went to the doctor, my
condition is normal."</p>

<p>And she thanks me for the invitation and thanks Michael also and says:</p>

<p>"I would try to take advantage of it if things really become worse, if Lee
becomes coarse with me again and treats me badly."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I direct your attention to the paragraph following that one, Mrs.
Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now another question:</p>

<p>"If as is possible it becomes necessary for me to come to live with you in order
to say that I am a dependent of Michael's surely it would be necessary to have
an official divorce, isn't that so? But I think Lee would not agree to a divorce,
and to go simply from him to become a burden to you that I don't wish. Surely
Michael would need to have a paper showing that I am living at his expense but
no one would just take his word for it, right?"</p>

<p>And I realized much later that in the Soviet Union you don't do anything without
the proper papers, and just having a person under your roof for anyone to
see, having them in fact eating at your table is not, would not be, sufficient proof&mdash;would
not be sufficient there in Russia.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. It might not be here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It might not be here. Well, in any case I judged she felt, reading
my invitations this was of some importance to me whether Michael counted her
as a deduction, and so on, whereas in fact this wasn't the point at all, but that
I had hoped to somehow make, if possible, for her to accept such help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you finished your observations?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. As a matter of fact, there are certain limitations
under our law as to how you can claim a dependent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I asked a few people who didn't know much about it before
I wrote it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The tenor then of this letter was as I gather from your testimony
and as you have related to me last evening whether she would come to
live with you in the fall or generally was something which now became subject
to reconsideration?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The matter of her coming to live with you, the possibility of
her living with you on a more extended basis <span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was an invitation I had made to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that her response was not acceptance but one that she
would now defer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a "thank you" and a refusal basically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you respond to that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did. My letter is dated July 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Liebeler will mark that Commission Exhibit 416, which
consists of how many pages, Mr. Liebeler, three pages. You have that exhibit.
Is that exhibit all in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the draft of letter to which you have reference being
your response to Marina's letter <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Undated letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Undated letter which would be somewhere just prior to July 21?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that a draft of letter in the same condition now as it
was when you completed it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you supplied the Commission with a translation of that
letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will mark as Commission Exhibits 417 and 418 two exhibits,
the first being a one-page exhibit entitled "Translation from Russian", and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
the second being a four page photograph of what appears to be a letter dated
July 21, 1963. Directing your attention to Exhibit 418.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you find it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please identify that exhibit? It consists of four
pages.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It appears to be a photograph of my letter to her of July 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having observed it and looked at it last night, is it your best
recollection at the moment that it is a photograph of the letter that you actually
transmitted to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to the next exhibit which is No. <span class="locked">418&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 417, you are talking about the translation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a translation of the letter, of your letter to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is far from complete.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is far from complete?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Far from complete. It is incomplete.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to have you make then, directing your attention
to the translation that has been supplied us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It goes as far as two-thirds down on page 2, you must have more
somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; that is all we have. Would you mark with this red
marker pen the point to which Exhibit 417 is a translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the translation accurate up to that point or rather do you
have any exceptions to it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In relation to what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "This would" on the next to the last paragraph "this would offend
my father very much." "This hurt my father", no subjunctive to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do it this way. Read what is on it, what the <span class="locked">interpreter&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Wait.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess that is just the interpreter trying to "offer you an
alternative". State the question again. You want to know if I take any exception
to the translation I have before me, this portion of my July 21 letter?
They are all small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are small and none of consequence.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So far as you are concerned. Your translation, however, that
you supplied the Commission is as far as you are concerned accurate and what
you intend to say, at least?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and I think it is what I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I offer in evidence, if the Chairman please, the documents
that have been marked&mdash;may I have them please, Representative Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. These, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Documents marked 415, 416, 417, and 418.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do I understand there is not a complete translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Of the letter. It is an incomplete translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is a page 2 somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct. During the noon hour I will see if that is not
a mistake and if I can be supplied with the balance, if there is a balance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted in this form and then you can advise us
after the recess whether there is anything additional to insert at this point.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos.
415, 416, 417, and 418, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there is a matter to which I would like to draw your
attention in your letter of July 21, which is Commission Exhibit No. 416, the
last portion of it, and I direct your attention, in turn, to your own interpretation
appearing at page 3. The last paragraph, when you brought Marina to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
New Orleans, did you do anything by way of seeking to have people in New
Orleans visit her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I have already testified that after an initial warm greeting
with Lee, they quarreled, and I was uncomfortable there, and wanted to
get back home. I had thought of making contact for Marina with someone in
the Russian speaking community in New Orleans, and later when I didn't hear
from her after this note that looks like "I will have to go back to Russia after
all," I much regretted that I had not made some contact for her, someone she
could talk to, herself. And anxious, not having heard from her a month from
the time of this appendage to my corrected letter, I telephoned Ruth Kloepfer
who is the clerk of the Quaker Meeting in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you spell her name, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is not someone I know. That is spelled K-L-O-E-P-F-E-R,
and I asked her if she knew any Russians in New Orleans. She did not. I then
wrote to Mrs. Paul Blanchard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, when you use the pronoun "she" there you asked
Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I asked Mrs. Kloepfer if she knew any Russian-speaking people
and described why I was interested in knowing. I must have given her the
address of Marina, probably asked that she go and see her. In any case, I
have a letter which followed that telephone call, which I wrote to Mrs. Paul
Blanchard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Pardon me, did you say you telephoned to Mrs. Blanchard or
you wrote to Mrs. Blanchard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote to Mrs. Blanchard, I had originally telephoned to Mrs.
Kloepfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make the telephone call when you were in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; this was when I was concerned. I had not heard from Marina
for a month. I did not know whether she was in good health or had gone back
to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you called Mrs. Kloepfer in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. After having tried to call the Murrets. I had
not had their name accurately.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How did you happen to write to Mrs. Blanchard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is the secretary of the Unitarian Church in New Orleans and
I called the Quaker Church in Dallas to find out who was in New Orleans of
the Quakers, and then I called the Unitarian Church which my husband belongs
to in Dallas to find out who the secretary of the New Orleans Unitarian Church
was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You do not know Mrs. Blanchard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not know her, and I did not know Mrs. Kloepfer either, and
appended to this that I am leaving with the Commission is my carbon of a
letter to Mrs. Blanchard of the Unitarian Church, which I sent in carbon to
Mrs. Kloepfer so each would know what the other was doing in an effort to
find a Russian-speaking person who could be a contact for Marina.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Ford left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you have now mentioned a letter that you wrote
to Mrs. Blanchard; have you supplied the Commission with a carbon copy of
that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is a two-page document, Mr. Chairman, dated July 18,
1963, now marked as Commission Exhibit 419. That exhibit has now been
handed to you, Mrs. Paine. Is that the carbon copy of your letter to Mrs.
Blanchard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not know Mrs. Blanchard, had never heard of her prior
to the time you wrote the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. It begins saying, "Mrs. Philip Harper, the
secretary of the Dallas Unitarian Church, suggested I write to you when I told
her of the following problem."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the document in the same condition now as it was when you
prepared the original of which that is a carbon copy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 419 the document
which has been so identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked for identification as Commission
Exhibit No. 419 and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Will there be any difficulty that it starts with typing and then
it goes carbon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Explain that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote two carbon paragraphs and then I thought I should
write a carbon of this to Mrs. Blanchard and put in a carbon and then in my
own copy put in typing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that which appears to be a copy is an original and that which
follows, what appears to be original, is an actual carbon copy of the letter you
actually sent to Mrs. Blanchard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With copy stated here to Mrs. Kloepfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear from Marina on that subject at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. In her succeeding and last letter that I got from her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her succeeding letter is dated what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It has no date inside. It is postmarked August 11 from New
Orleans and sent to me while I was on vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 420 the envelope
and attached to 420 is what purports to be a four-page letter in Russian
longhand&mdash;may we have this as a group exhibit consisting of the envelope and
the four-page letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. If it is properly attached I guess you can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is no date on the letter, if they separate you don't know
what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have marked the four-page letter as Commission Exhibit 421
in order to avoid any difficulty.</p>

<p>Directing your attention to Exhibit 421, do you recognize the handwriting
on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is Marina Oswald's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a letter to you, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you supplied the Commission with your translation of that
letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That appears at pages 13 and 14 of the materials you furnished
me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that letter in the same condition now as it was when you
received it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; with the exception of an addition in my handwriting on
the bottom of unmarked page 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which is a translation of one word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What word is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A word means to grow downcast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I didn't catch that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To grow downcast, to lose courage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to the envelope which is marked Commission
Exhibit 420.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I want to make one other comment. I underlined the word on
the second page that I have translated as "winsome."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. W-i-n-s-o-m-e?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The other underlinings in her letter are her own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Directing your attention to the pink envelope which
is Commission Exhibit No. 420, was Exhibit 421 enclosed in Exhibit 420?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That also is in English, that is the address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The address is in English, addressed to me while on vacation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you received those documents in due course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You received the documents in due course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not forwarded. It was addressed to me where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you received them is all I am asking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits 420 and 421, the
documents which have been so marked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 420 and
421 for identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is one item in Exhibit 421 to which I wish to direct your
attention. On the last page about the third paragraph from the bottom appears
the second sentence, "Lee doesn't have work now already three weeks." Do you
find that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any information prior to the receipt of this letter
that Lee Oswald no longer was employed in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no such information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was your first information?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you respond to that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have a five-page document Mr. Liebeler is identifying as Commission
Exhibit No. 422.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is not what you want. You want my reply, don't you next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is not it. You have my reply but I had had no copy of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will keep that exhibit number. There has been identified
as Commission Exhibit 423 an exhibit consisting of four pages, the first three
of which are a photograph of a letter, and the last page of which is a photograph
of an envelope. Handing you Commission Exhibit No. 423, is that a picture of
your letter to Marina Oswald in response to her letter of August 11?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. August 11. Yes; it is dated August 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do recognize that as being a picture copy of letter you
had written?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you supplied the Commission with a translation of that
letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not. I did not have this in rough draft. I had no
copy of this. You may have a translation but I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I supplied you only on this summary that you have with a brief
recollection of what it contained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I now hand you a document, Commission Exhibit No. 424 consisting
of two pages which purports to be a translation of Exhibit 423. Did
you review that translation with me last evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection at the moment of what you said
last night that the translation is of Exhibit 423?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is approximately what I recall writing. I didn't look at the
Russian in your pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the noon recess would you wish to look at that and if
you have any exception you wish to take to the translation would you please
state it to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I intervene at this point about Exhibit 422, has that been
properly identified?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; not yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could we return it to the witness? Exhibit 422 is in whose
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is in my handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a draft of a letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a letter which I wrote but never sent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You testified about that letter yesterday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is dated April 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you supplied the Commission with a translation, your
translation of that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have with appropriate paragraph before it saying that
it was not sent, that I wrote it not necessarily to send or give to her but simply
to have, I think as I testified yesterday, the words at my command ready in
case it seemed appropriate to make such an invitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was prepared on or about April 7, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would judge on the 7th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that letter in the same condition now as it was when you
completed writing it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have added since completing writing, I have added in pencil
at the top, "not sent" in English. It is otherwise the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I won't go into that further, Mr. Chairman, because the witness
did testify about it yesterday other than to offer the document in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I simply thought it needed a little elaboration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were quite right, sir.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 422 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where were you in the summer of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. May I interrupt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did you want to make any reference to the reference to Lee's
driving in Exhibit 424?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you very much, Mrs. Paine, and I do want to go into it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have it underlined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Dulles, would you be good enough to let me have it? This
translation which appears as Commission Exhibit 424, the fourth paragraph
reads "Lee told me that he learned a little from his Uncle how to drive a car.
It would be very useful for him to know how to drive but it is hard to find
time for this when he works every day."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might make a comment about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is your comment, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might make a comment about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is your comment, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the Commission is very interested in the subject matter of
Mr. Oswald, of Lee Oswald being able to drive a car and I think it might be
well if we covered the whole subject from the beginning to the end.</p>

<p>Would you give the Commission your full, most accurate recollection of this
whole subject? Start at the very beginning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I learned either in March or April that <span class="locked">Lee&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This would be early in your acquaintance with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very early. I learned Lee was not able to drive and didn't have
a license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you learn he was not able to drive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was related to his looking for work the first time in the
middle of April, and I had learned he had looked in the Dallas area for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you learn it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We were talking about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were talking with Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he tell you that he was not able to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he had never learned how.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he had difficulty in getting around?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Simply he had never learned how.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said this to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And I felt immediately that his job opportunities, the jobs
to which he could have applied, and the jobs to which he could get himself would
be greatly broadened if he were able to drive and said so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said that to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And said that to him. Then when we arrived in New Orleans
he said to me by way of almost pride that he had been allowed by his uncle to
drive his uncle's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Mr. Murret?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know whether there was more than one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he volunteered the statement to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was something that had occurred after he had gotten to
New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And he was in a sense pleased to report to me that he was getting
some experience driving. That his uncle had permitted him to drive the car on
the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion while you were in New Orleans to verify
that in any respect whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or have it verified to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was confined to a remark that he made to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Then when I learned in Marina's letter of August
11 that Lee was out of work, I immediately thought it would be well for him to
make use of those free weekdays, not only for job hunting but for learning the
skill of driving and, therefore, that paragraph&mdash;shall we read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Haven't I already read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean from your letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did you read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The paragraph "Lee told me that he learned a little from his
uncle how to drive a car."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you read that "It would be very useful for him to know how
to drive but it is hard to find time for this when he works every day."</p>

<p>Just to be certain of this, Mrs. Paine, this was a remark made to you by Lee
Harvey Oswald when you brought Marina from Irving, Tex., to New Orleans,
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The second week in May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The second week in May of 1963. And then, according to the
remark made to you by Lee Harvey Oswald that his uncle had permitted him
to drive his uncle's car on the street in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and he was proud of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ask at that time or any time while you were in New
Orleans in the spring to drive your car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion at all during&mdash;did you have the feeling
that he would like to drive the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no discussion of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he demonstrate to you that he could drive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no discussion of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have given us all that occurred in New Orleans by way of
conversation or otherwise on the subject of Lee Harvey Oswald driving an
automobile or his ability to drive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you are telling us the whole story on this subject. So
when <span class="locked">next&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask this one question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did Lee Oswald identify the uncle who permitted him to drive
his car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Senator Cooper, he did not. He just said his uncle. He did not
identify his uncle by name.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you know of your own knowledge who the uncle was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can only assume.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can only assume it was the uncle he had been staying with. He
had been staying at his home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had met the uncle at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So it was the uncle with whom he had been staying just before
he obtained the apartment at Magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What is the uncle's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Dutz Murret. This was the relative who had the nice home
that Marina first saw when she arrived there and thought maybe that is where
she was going to live, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You want all other references to driving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Confining yourself to his ability to drive automobiles, when
next, and take it in chronological order as to when you next recall it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It came up next after he returned to the Dallas area in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After he returned on the 4th, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 4th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the first I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will get into the reasons and the circumstances but you stick
with the automobile incidents.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was looking for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the Dallas area and again, of course, I felt that he could find
more jobs, be eligible for more if he could drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recalled that I had a copy of the regulations for driving, what
you need to know to pass the written test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what State?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the State of Texas, and I gave him that booklet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a discussion with him about your desire, your
recommendation, that he qualify to drive an automobile in Texas so it would
assist him in connection with his job hunting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably. We certainly had conversation about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give us the subject of the conversation in terms of recommendations
by you, or what did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I again recommended, as I had in the spring, that he learn to
drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was interested in learning to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would like to offer to the Commission something we didn't get
to last night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which is a letter I wrote to my mother, which she just showed me
recently, she just found it recently, which makes reference to the date I first gave
him a lesson in driving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be helpful to us. May I have the letter, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Now only a portion of it is applicable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why don't we give it a number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Another portion is applicable in another connection, which I
would like especially to bring up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having that in mind, we will give that document for identification
at the moment only, the number Commission Exhibit No. 425.</p>

<p>I won't identify it beyond that for the moment because the witness will be
using it to refresh her recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will read what applies here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now reading from Commission Exhibit No. 425.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which is a letter dated October 14, in my hand, from me to my
mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you give your mother's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her name is Mrs. Carol Hyde.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In Columbus, Ohio. It was likely written to Oberlin, where she
was a student at that time.</p>

<p>"If Lee can just find work that will help so much. Meantime I started giving
him driving lessons last Sunday (yesterday). If he can drive this will open
up more job possibilities and more locations."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I want to comment too on the nature of this lesson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Commission will be interested in that but you go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I knew that he had not even a learner's permit to drive. I wasn't
interested in his driving on the street with my car until he had such. But on
Sunday the parking lot of a neighboring shopping center was empty, and I am
quite certain that is where the driving lesson took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your best present recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Now I recall this also, and it is significant. I offered him a
lesson and intended to drive him to this area for him to practice. He, however,
started the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He got in and started the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He got in and started the car so that I know he was able to do
that and wanted to drive on the street to the parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He wanted to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He wanted to. I said, "My father is an insurance man and he
would never forgive me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My father. And insisted that he get a learner's permit before
he would drive on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that moment and at that time he acted, in any event in your
presence, as though he himself <span class="locked">thought&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would be capable of driving an automobile from your home
to the parking area in which you were about to give him a lesson. That was
your full impression, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I should add that, as I am recalling, he did drive a portion
of the way, he drove in fact, it is about three blocks, to the parking lot. I was
embarrassed to just tell him "No, don't." But I did, in, effect, on the way
there, when he was on the street, driving on the street in my car, when we got
there I said, "Now, I am going to drive back." I didn't want him to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your home to the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The first time before we had any lesson at all. And at that
time I made it clear I didn't want him to drive in the street. Also, it became
clear to me in that lesson that he was very unskilled in driving. We practiced a
number of the things you need to know, to back up, to turn, right angle turn to
come to a stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this on the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was all on a parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did I understand you to say he drove three blocks, was that
all the way to the parking lot? So he drove all the way to the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Perhaps a little longer. But a short distance, whatever it was,
to the parking lot, yes. Rather than stopping in midstreet and changing drivers.
Going to turn a right <span class="locked">angle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How well did he do on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is what she is telling.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that is a separate answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She is talking about the parking lot.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was very nervous while he was doing it and was not at all
happy about his doing it. I would say he did modestly well; but no means
skilled in coming to a stop and turning a square right angle at a corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there much traffic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. But then too, I noticed when we got to the parking lot when
he attempted to turn in a right angle he made the usual mistake of a beginner
of turning too much and then having to correct it. He was not familiar with
the delay of the steering wheel in relation to the wheels, actual wheels of
the <span class="locked">power&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it <span class="locked">power&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not power steering. But it has no clutch so that makes
it a lot easier to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is an automatic transmission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is an automatic transmission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe your automobile, will you please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a 1955 Chevrolet station wagon, green, needing paint,
which we bought secondhand. It is in my name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But automatic transmission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Automatic transmission; yes.</p>

<p>Then, in the later lessons, I think there were altogether three with <span class="locked">Lee&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you finished with this lesson on the Sunday morning,
was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was a Sunday afternoon and I drove back to the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did the lesson take on the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, 20 minutes, perhaps. I will say of him that he set for himself
tasks; a good student in the sense that he planned now I am going to back up
this way and I am going&mdash;one of the problems is to turn around and go the
other way on the street. In other <span class="locked">words&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. U-turn.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is not a U-turn, no. It is a narrower one to head in back up
and go the other way and he would set this problem for himself, how to do it,
back up and do it, and set the problem of backing up, driving, going back, I
mean. And set himself a course. I was doing this, too, but I was interested
in the eagerness he had and his desire to achieve; desire to do this and do it
well.</p>

<p>In helping himself by setting up these course plans, you could almost say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Would you refresh my recollection of the date this occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My letter is dated the 14th. I say, "I taught him yesterday,
Sunday."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fourteenth of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Fourteenth of October. So that would have <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would have been October 7?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Thirteenth.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask a question here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Senator Cooper has a question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. On the occasion when you drove with him, did you find it
necessary to show him how to turn on the ignition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How to take steps to start the car and put it in motion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, indeed; he had started it before I came out or else he wouldn't
have been in the driver's seat because I didn't want him to drive on the street.
So he had the car ready to go; backed out with a considerable bump.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He backed out of the driveway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am recalling this now, I think so. I recall that he then didn't
attempt to go, I didn't let him, but at one point we practiced parking on the
street in front of my house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a subsequent occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was a subsequent occasion. But when the lesson was done
he gradually let me turn the car into the driveway. This is harder and I was
glad to do it and he was glad to be relieved of that requirement.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to interrupt this line of
inquiry, but I have to go to a meeting at the Speaker's office and I can't be back
this afternoon, and I wonder if I might ask Mrs. Paine several questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. By all means.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Not particularly in this line.</p>

<p>Where did you first meet Marina. I know you told us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. She testified to that yesterday.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Tell me briefly.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At a party of people at the end of February 1963.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How long was it thereafter that she moved into your
home for the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She first came on the 24th of April.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And she lived there for 2 weeks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And her husband lived here&mdash;her husband was with
her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. He had already gone on to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. When did she return to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She came with me from New Orleans, leaving there the 23d of
September and arriving in Irving the 24th of September.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And she lived with you in Irving from the 24th of
September until the 23d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The morning of the 23d.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Of November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She left the morning of the 23d, she left expecting to come back.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. During that period of time did Lee Oswald live there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. He visited there on weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He visited there on weekends.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How well did you know Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Insufficiently well.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I regret, of course, very deeply that I didn't perceive him
as a violent man.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You saw no evidence of violence in him at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I didn't. He argued with his wife but he never struck her.
I never heard from her of any violence from him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he ever express any hostility toward anyone while
he was talking with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not of a violent <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he ever express any political opinions to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, he called himself a Marxist. He said that on the occasion
after Stevenson had been in town in relation to the United Nations Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Adlai Stevenson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Adlai Stevenson, and Lee had been to a meeting of the National
Indignation Committee held another night that week, and he was at our home
the following Friday night and commented that he didn't like General Walker.</p>

<p>This is the only thing I heard from him on the subject.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he ever express any violence toward General
Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he ever discuss President Kennedy with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He never mentioned Kennedy at all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you see the rifle that he had in the room in your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the garage, no.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. In the garage, you never saw one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw that rifle at all until the police showed it to me in the
station on the 22d of November.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Were you at home when the FBI interviewed Marina
and Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The FBI never interviewed Marina and me; I was waiting to
hear your question.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. At your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The FBI never interviewed Marina and Lee at my home. The
FBI was there one afternoon and talked to Marina through me; they never
saw Lee Oswald in my home. I told them he would be there on a weekend.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you ever discuss politics with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As close as we would come, I would say, would be what I have
mentioned about Madam Nhu; she was interested in what the family would do.
She also said to me that she thought Khrushchev was a rather coarse, country
person. She said that she admired Mrs. Kennedy a great deal, and liked, this
is all before, liked President Kennedy very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was all before November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Were you aware of the fact that Lee returned to your
home the night before the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Were you curious about that in view of the fact that
he seldom came except on weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was the first time he had come without asking permission to
come. He came after he and his wife had quarreled, and Marina and I said
to one another, we took this to be as close as he could come to an apology, and
an effort to make up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That was the reason you thought he had come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But I didn't inquire of him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You did not know that the next morning when he left
he had a rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you see him when he left that morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Have you been active in politics yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I vote. And I am a member of the League of Women Voters,
that is the extent of my activity.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Do you belong to any other political organizations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever belonged?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Are you, I don't know quite how to state this question,
are you a practicing Quaker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.   I am also a pacifist.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You are a pacifist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You are not a Marxist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; they don't go together, in fact. You can't believe violent
overthrow and be a pacifist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know Norman Thomas quite well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I was 8 I went to a rally of Norman Thomas in New York
City. That was my only contact.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Is your feeling towards Marina, shall I say in the
Quaker spirit of friendship and hospitality, was that the main objective, plus
the intellectual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was interested in the language.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Intellectual stimulation of the language.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I found that while living with her, I could say that this
day, at least added something to what I knew, what I&mdash;I learned a few more
words.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You never formed any opinion about Lee Oswald as a
person?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I formed many, and I would like to make that a special area.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Would you just tell me just in a sentence or two, I
know you could go into it in greater detail, but was your opinion favorable?
Was it unfavorable, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I disliked him actively in the spring when I thought he just
wanted to get rid of his wife and wasn't caring about her, wasn't concerned
whether she would go to the doctor. I then found him much nicer, I thought,
when I saw him next in New Orleans in late September, and this would be a
perfectly good time to admit the rest of the pertinent part of this letter to my
mother written October 14, because it shows something that I think should be
part of the public record, and I am one of the few people who can give it, that
presents Lee Oswald as a human person, a person really rather ordinary, not an
ogre that was out to leave his wife, and be harsh and hostile to all that he knew.</p>

<p>But in this brief period during the times that he came out on weekends, I saw
him as a person who cared for his wife and his child, tried to make himself
helpful in my home, tried to make himself welcome although he really preferred
to stay to himself.</p>

<p>He wasn't much to take up a conversation. This says, "Dear Mom," this is
from Commission Exhibit No. 425, "Lee Oswald is looking for work in Dallas.
Did my last letter say so? Probably not. He arrived a week and a half ago and
has been looking for work since. It is a very depressing business for him, I
am sure. He spent last weekend and the one before with us here and was a
happy addition to our expanded family. He played with Chris"&mdash;my 3-year-old,
then 2&mdash;"watched football on the TV, planed down the doors that wouldn't
close, they had shifted and generally added a needed masculine <span class="locked">flavor"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Wait a second.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "And generally added a needed masculine flavor. From a
poor first impression I have come to like him. We saw the doctor at Parkland
Hospital last Friday and all seems very healthy" and this refers to Marina.
"It appears that charges will be geared to their ability to pay."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Were <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. May I go on?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Yes; surely. Finish.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was an intervening section where he was the most human
that I saw him, and, of course, it has been followed by my anger with him, and
all the feeling that most of us have about his act. But it seems to me important,
very important, to the record that we face the fact that this man was not only
human but a rather ordinary one in many respects, and who appeared ordinary.</p>

<p>If we think that this was a man such as we might never meet, a great aberration
from the normal, someone who would stand out in a crowd as unusual,
then we don't know this man, we have no means of recognizing such a person
again in advance of a crime such as he committed.</p>

<p>The important thing, I feel, and the only protection we have is to realize
how human he was though he added to it this sudden and great violence
<span class="locked">beyond&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You have no doubt about the fact that he assassinated
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no present doubt.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Do you have any reason to believe he was associated
with anyone else in this act or it was part of a conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no reason to believe he was associated with anyone.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you ever see him talking with anyone else, in
conversation with anybody else or get mail at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw him talking with anyone else. He received all
his mail from home, third class for the most part perhaps one letter from
Russia.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he have telephone calls at your home of a mysterious
nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, did he ever have a telephone call at your home
mysterious or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; never.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You then would be surprised if he were part of any
group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would be very surprised. For one thing, I judged, I had to
wonder whether this man was a spy or someone dangerous to our Nation.
He had been to the Soviet Union and he had come back and he didn't go as
a tourist. He went by his own admission intending to become a Soviet citizen
and then came back.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What about Marina&mdash;go ahead and finish.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then the FBI came, as I thought they well might, interested in
this man who had been to the Soviet Union, and I felt that if he had associations
this would be very easy for them to know. I didn't see any, but would
tend to point to the possibility of his being a spy or subversive. But I didn't
see any such and I felt happy that they were charged with the responsibility
of knowing about it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you see any indication of any connection of
Marina with any group that might be considered unusual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; no one called her.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did she have any letters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She received a letter from a friend in the Soviet Union which
she showed to me and mentioned to me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was this just a normal letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Girl friend.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What is your present relationship with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have seen her once since the assassination. That was a week
ago Monday. It was the first time since the morning of the 23d when she
left my house, both of us expecting she would come back to it that evening.
In the intervening period I wrote her a collection of letters trying to determine
what her feelings were and whether it was suitable for me to write and see her.</p>

<p>I am presently confused, as I was then, as to how to best be a friend to her.
I don't know what is appropriate in this situation.</p>

<p>By that I mean during the time I was writing the letters to her and not
getting an answer when she was with Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was your conversation last Monday friendly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Might I ask one question?</p>

<p>You said that Lee had mentioned General Walker and indicated that he
didn't like General Walker. Can you elaborate on that a little bit, to what
extent, how violent was he in his expression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it wasn't violent at all. It was more of, oh, well, more not
giving him much credit even, but it was done briefly, this was in passing, so
my recollection is hazy. But certainly there was no strong expression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. No vehemence about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely not, I would have remembered that. And I recall
that Marina said nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You mentioned that Lee did not receive any calls at your house.
Did he make any telephone calls?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I heard him call what he said was the "Time." You know, he
dialed, listened and hung up, and then he told us what time it was. That is
all his social contact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. This is only on one occasion that he spoke of General Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just that one in my hearing, apropos of a discussion that was
already begun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. We have rather interrupted the sequence of your questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. There is one item I might bring out along the line you
were inquiring about.</p>

<p>You gave some consideration, did you not, Mrs. Paine, during this period,
as to whether Mr. Oswald, Lee Harvey Oswald, could or might have been a
Russian agent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And we discussed this yesterday, as I recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what conclusions did you come to on that score and why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought that he was not very intelligent. I saw as far as I
could see he had no particular contacts. He was not a person I would have
hired for a job of any sort, no more than I would have let him borrow my car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you give consideration in that connection? Did his level of
intelligence affect your judgment as to whether the Russian Government would
have hired him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did it affect you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I doubted they would have hired him. I kept my mind open on
it to wonder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had doubt why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Simply because he had gone to the Soviet Union and announced
that he wanted to stay, and then came back, and I wasn't convinced that he
liked America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your judgment of him, and as to his level of intelligence,
affect your decision ultimately that the Russian Government might not or
would not have hired him because he was not a man of capacity to serve in
such a way for the Russian Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that affected my judgment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you any idea as to his motivation in the act, in light of
what you have said in the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is conjecture, of course, but I feel he always felt himself to
be a small person; and he was right. That he wanted to be greater, or noticed,
and Marina had said of him he thinks he is so big and fine, and he should
take a more realistic view of himself and not be so conceited.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I feel that he acted much more from the emotional pushings
within him than from any rational set of ideas, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Emotional pushings toward aggrandizement you have in mind
is what you said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you testified earlier this morning, Mrs. Paine, about the
dry sighting of the rifle, you know what dry sighting is, don't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I found out last night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You found that out last night?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Tell her to describe it then.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Shall I try to describe it? See if I know? It involves holding
the rifle and as if to fire and pulling the trigger, but without any ammunition
in it. Going through the motions and, therefore, wiggling it and having to
resight it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Going through the motions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of ejecting something.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. A dry run.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that sufficient, Senator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do I understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is a pretty good description, it is just as well as I can give.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You actually saw him doing this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, he showed me last night how it was done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. We had testimony this morning whether he had an opportunity
to dry sight the rifle in his New Orleans house.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was just discussing what would be visible in the front of his
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We were having some testimony, Representative Ford, of Lee
Harvey Oswald's dry sighting of the rifle when he was in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Marina so testified when she was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You don't purport to say it was impossible for him to do it
without observation but it was difficult.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was difficult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
My then 2-year-old boy found a number of boys with trucks to play with
right on that immediate driveway or alley as it is marked on the paper and
small boys would have been very interested and they went right by there and
Marina complained that Junie couldn't get her nap because there were so
many children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. He could have done it very early in the morning without observation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you any idea generally how Lee Oswald used his time, I
mean when you weren't observing him when he wasn't at your house? Did he
talk, tell you how he used his time? Did he use it on television? What I am
trying to get at is&mdash;is there a great deal of time he had available to him that
there is no way of knowing what he did. But did he talk about that, did he
give you an idea of what he was, how he occupied himself, reading, television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Talking just about the time after October 4 when he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes; let's take it in that period.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I knew he was occupied with looking for a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. How much of the day this occupied him, of course, I didn't know.
I didn't see him. Then he got the job, and I judge that occupied him more fully.
He spoke of one evening meeting he went to, this National Indignation Committee
meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What about other evenings? Do you know anything about other
evenings when he wasn't with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except for the one in which he accompanied my husband to a
Civil Liberties Union meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you, at any stage of your life while you were, whether
living with your husband or apart from him, did you ever contemplate inviting
anyone to come and live with you in anything like the manner in which you
did invite Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My mother completed her studies at Oberlin College in February,
and we <span class="locked">talked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. February 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; just now, February of 1964 and we talked about the possibility
as long ago as last summer of 1963, we talked about the possibility of
her coming and staying for several months. I said I was tired of living alone.
This is not exactly comparable, but it also is a search for a roommate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But apart from your mother, there was no one similarly situated
to Marina, whom you thought of inviting to live with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No one situated similarly that I knew either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. No; you didn't invite anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Didn't make any other such invitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Anyone to live with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before returning to the automobile and somewhat along the
tail end at least of Representative Boggs' inquiries of you, did you ever give any
consideration, Mrs. Paine, to the possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald might
have been employed by some agency of the Government of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never gave that any consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It never occurred to you at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It never occurred to me at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all on that.</p>

<p>Was the absence of its occurring to you based on your overall judgment of
Lee Harvey Oswald and his lack, as you say, of, not a highly intelligent man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was some reason why you gave it no thought, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That, and he was not in a position to know anything of use to
either Government. I am questioning myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please elaborate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As regards he might be a Soviet agent, what does this man know
that would be of interest to anybody or what could you find out, and you judge
he didn't know anything that the Soviets might be interested in, and, as I say,
I never gave it any thought of the possibility of his being employed by this
Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Representative Ford, Mrs. Paine had been relating to us
her experiences with Lee Harvey Oswald with respect to his ability to operate
an automobile, and she has up to this moment revealed some things to us which
we had not known of and it is something that is causing the staff considerable
concern. This is his ability to drive which is a proper connection with his
visit to Mexico in some one or two instances and also his escape or his attempted
escape and other elements.</p>

<p>We interrupted the chronology to have Mrs. Paine state fully everything she
knows on this particular subject.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If we can recall just about where you were because I would like to
have you pick it up just exactly where you were in this chronology.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had about completed the full statement of what I saw of his
driving.</p>

<p>I will pick up by repeating when he turned a right angle corner he would
turn too far and have to correct. I will complete now by describing my teaching
him to park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this on that same Sunday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There were, I think, three altogether, but I am not certain. This
is the only particular reference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, but I think, Mr. Chairman, Representative Ford,
Mrs. Paine has related to us something we had not known, that this Sunday
<span class="locked">afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. October 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. October 13, when she sought to instruct Lee Harvey Oswald on
the local parking lot&mdash;was it by a shopping center?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he had gotten into the car, in the driveway, with the key,
and had turned on the motor of the car, had backed it up into the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then proceeded to drive to the shopping center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. While I complained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine complaining because she was concerned; she is the
daughter of an insurance actuary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In my complaint I simply said that I would drive back, and that
I didn't want him to drive on the street, but I didn't insist that he stop at that
moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall one other afternoon when he practiced just parking directly
in front of our house, and when, as I say, after he had done this he wanted
me to drive the car into the driveway, that being a little harder to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you keep your car ordinarily, in the driveway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Always in the driveway in front of our house; the garage itself is
too full of many other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you leave the key in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never leave the key in the car; I always lock it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your habit with respect to the ignition key?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I always lock the car and leave the ignition key in my purse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never leave the ignition key around your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, my purse was in the home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So it was not in the open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He had to go in the purse, never. Just how he got the car started,
I recall my shock that he had. But I must have laid out the key or something
because I did not intend for him to start it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't give him the key on that occasion to go out and start
the motor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But when you came out of the house he had already started the
motor and backed the car into the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no; I let him back it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was deciding what I was going to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were in the car at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I had gotten in the car at that time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And he was in the driver's seat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he in the driver's seat when you came out of the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection. Then, referring now to the practice of his
parking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Representative Ford, the witness had also related to
us, which we had not known, when she came to New Orleans in the spring to
bring Marina from Irving to New Orleans, that Lee Harvey Oswald told her
that he had driven his uncle's car, one of the Murrets, in New Orleans on the
street.</p>

<p>Go ahead.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Perhaps I should say that I have been absent for a half
hour or so attending a very important committee meeting, so I didn't get this
story from the outset and I appreciate being brought up to date on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There were two occasions when we practiced parking, one in the
larger parking lot just backing into, pretending there were cars there to back
between, as in parallel parking, and another occasion directly in front of my
house. On this second occasion directly in front of my house he finally learned
how to do it. He had had a bad time, getting his wheels too cramped and not
getting in, and getting his wheels straightened out, a beginner's mistakes.</p>

<p>Finally, I got into the car and told him when to start reversing the twist on
his wheel and cramp, and he said, so soon. It was a surprise. It didn't feel to
him it was time already to start coming out of the turn.</p>

<p>And then he saw that it was when he then got into the parking place correctly,
and quite soon got the feel of it but this was clearly his first experience doing it
right, and then he practiced doing it right several times, and he learned quite well,
I thought.</p>

<p>(At this point, Chief Justice Warren entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On these subsequent occasions did he ask you to help him
or did he take the keys and do it on his own initiative?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, he never took the keys. I offered to give him&mdash;give Lee lessons
on Sunday afternoons and we managed to do it a few Sunday afternoons, I think
three altogether and there were a couple of weekends when we didn't get the
lesson in, something intervened.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was in October of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. October and November. I think the last lesson was November 10,
being the last Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What progress did he make over that period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Considerable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Reasonable progress?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very reasonable progress. I thought he learned well, as I have
said, both backing and to make a right-angle turn, and really began to understand
the feeling of parking.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he indicate to you when he might apply for a driver's
license?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Oh, yes. Thank you. It is a whole new section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was about to go into that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There was some testimony on that point, I believe.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Frazier testified that Oswald mentioned to him
that he was going to or had, I am not sure which, and I was wondering whether
he mentioned it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Got in line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, on November 9, which was election day, Saturday, in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was the weekend he was home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was the weekend that he was home, which was the last
weekend he was home, don't call it home though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am sorry. It was the last weekend that he was at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he arrived the previous day, evening or late afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now starting with that Friday afternoon, please relate the
course of events?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I will say that we went Saturday morning to a station
in Dallas where you can take the written test and eye test that permits you to
get a learner's permit, but when we got there&mdash;that is all of us, children, Lee,
Marina and myself, driving in my car to Oak Cliff&mdash;when we got there it was
closed, being election day. I hadn't thought, realized that this would mean it
would be closed. So we returned.</p>

<p>The next <span class="locked">weekend&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, before you reach that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you reasonably certain that he came home or came to
Irving the previous afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps to refresh your recollection, do you remember a weekend
in which Lee Harvey Oswald called from Dallas and said to Marina that
he would not be in that Friday afternoon because he was going to do some
job hunting the next morning, and that he would come the next day? Could
it be that this was that weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he had already had a job that weekend, didn't he? So
he wouldn't have been job hunting. I recall he was there in the morning, Saturday
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Looking for another job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, well, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall any discussion of his being dissatisfied with
the job at the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was undertaking to look for another job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is no discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is one Saturday that he came out later but that was still
in October. It was the second weekend that he came out, altogether he came out
on the weekend of the 4th, so he would have come out on October 12, Saturday.
It doesn't check with my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So just to make sure, it is your present recollection that you
can recall no occasion when you were advised by Marina or directly that Lee
Harvey Oswald called and said he would not be in on that particular Friday but
would come the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would be quite certain it was not that weekend. It is possible
that this happened, I don't recall any discussion, nor did I have any idea
that there had been any occasion when he had to look for a different job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Never any discussion on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Just to complete the discussion of automobile driving, I will go on to the
next weekend then when he did not come out to my house, but <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That would be the weekend of the 18th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just prior to the assassination. The 16th I was having a birthday
party for my little girl and said I couldn't possibly take him again to
this place so he could take a test. But that he didn't need a car. This was
news to him. He thought he needed a car for his initial test, learner's permit.
I said he could go himself from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a conversation between you and Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did it take place?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It must have been by phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he call you or did you call him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He called to the house nearly every night around 5:30 to talk
to Marina. And Marina suggested to him that he wouldn't, shouldn't come
out that weekend because I was having a birthday party and it had been a long
weekend, the prior weekend. She didn't want him to wear out his welcome,
and then I said to him he could still try to <span class="locked">get&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did talk with him on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection. I am certain that I talked with him,
that he was surprised that he didn't need a car. I had to tell him that he
didn't need a car to take with him to take his test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Take his initial test?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Take his test, and suggested that he go from Dallas himself
to take this test. Then he called us Saturday afternoon of the 16th to say
he had been and tried to get his driver's permit but that he had arrived before
closing time but still too late to get in because there was a long line ahead
of him, the place having been closed both the previous Saturday for election
day and the following Monday, the 11th, Veterans Day. There were a lot of
people who wanted to get permits and he was advised that it wouldn't pay him
to wait in line. He didn't have time to be tested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you help us fix, can you recall as closely as possible the day
of the week, this is the weekend of the assassination, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The weekend before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The weekend before, and this conversation you are now relating
that you had with him in which he said that he had gone to the driver's license
station, when did that conversation with you take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That conversation was with Marina, and she told me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did she tell you about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He called her, it must have been Saturday afternoon, soon after
he had been, he went Saturday morning and they closed at noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. This was the weekend he did not come out to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was the weekend he did not come out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The weekend in which you had your birthday party for your son
was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was either that same afternoon or it was possibly Sunday, I
don't recall. It is important though. I wish I could recall when his call to her
was. Since it relates to the problem of when I dialed his number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 426 a
form or document which purports to be a driver's permit or driver's license permit
application by Lee Harvey Oswald. It is a one-page form document on heavy
board, or at least heavy paper.</p>

<p>Are you familiar sufficiently with the handwriting or handprinting of Lee
Harvey Oswald to be able to tell us whether the writing and handprinting on that
document is or is not Lee Harvey Oswald's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not sufficiently familiar. I can simply compare it with the
only other thing I have seen in his printing which is what he wrote down in my
diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Refreshing your recollection in that respect and looking at the
exhibit, if you are able to do so, would you give us your opinion as to whether
the exhibit is in the handwriting or handprinting of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it very likely is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your short talk with Lee Harvey Oswald on the subject of his
having gone to the license application department in Dallas, was anything said
about his actually having filled out a driver's license or a learner's permit
application?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we have the date of this document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If it is dated. My recollection is it is not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His birthday is on it only. Picked up at his room on the date of
the assassination. I guess it was picked up, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could I review this with you a little bit? Did Lee Harvey
Oswald on this occasion tell you in the course of what limited telephone conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
you had with him, that he had gone to the driver's license application
bureau?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he told Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did&mdash;he told Marina and then Marina in turn told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How near the time of the telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She told me immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina tell you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She just turned from the phone and told you at once?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was spontaneous?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It may have been while she was still on the phone, I don't
recall, but it certainly was immediate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Dulles, to answer your question the document is not dated.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I was just noticing in the upper right-hand corner on
the one side he lists his occupation as photographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; this is so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is what he wanted to do, not what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate to the Commission what your impression
of what his occupation was or occupation had been during the period of time that
you had known him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I first met him he was working at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall.
And had expressed himself as liking his work. I gathered that it was a kind of
copying or making up of advertising layout, develop a photographic process.</p>

<p>When we arrived at New Orleans he pointed to a building where he was working.
I saw no writing on the outside of the building. He said&mdash;no, first on the
phone when he first called to say he had a job, he said he was doing work similar
to what he had been doing, photographic type of work.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Work in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He called to us in Dallas from New Orleans to say he was doing
such work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Subsequently, I have heard it is not so, but this is what he told
Marina and she told me over the phone. He said, and she told me immediately
over the phone, that he was getting $1.50 an hour instead of $1.25 he had been
getting, and then in New Orleans he pointed to a building where he was working,
somewhere along the river, near the French Quarter, but a big large brick building
with no particular designation on it. I don't know what sort of building it was,
but he said it was the photo outfit where he was working then.</p>

<p>When he was looking for a job he said, now, in October, early October, he came
back to the Dallas area and he was looking for a job, he said he was hopeful of
getting similar work again, photographic layout, whatever it was. But that he
was pleased to get any job that would produce an income.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. For the Commission's information, Mr. Jenner, is this not, that
is Exhibit No. 426, a form which Lee Oswald apparently took home, or filled out
somewhere, either his home or at the office, but it was never sworn to and is not
signed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It is not a completed document. It has no date on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is my information and there will be testimony and that is why
I didn't go into the document, that it was found in his, among his effects in his
room on Beckley Street. With permission, I might describe the document possibly
a little more in detail in view of the interest and the question. At the top
of the document under name there is hand printing on this form, first the form
is entitled "Application for Texas Driver's License."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. May I interrupt?</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:45 o'clock the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

faintly that they appear to be periods or colons: some were found and
corrected, but some almost certainly remain.</p>
